## Features

### 📦 Homebrew Package Management

- **Manage Installed Packages**: Browse installed formulae and casks, uninstall
  either type, and pin or unpin formulae with confirmed, refresh-safe actions
- **Search & Install**: Search formulae and casks, confirm the selected package
  type, and install with loading, error, refresh, and dry-run states
- **Update & Upgrade**: Keep Homebrew up-to-date and upgrade outdated packages individually
- **App Collections**: Install a curated set of apps and tools in one step
- **Tap Trust Management**: Homebrew 6's per-tap trust model hides packages installed from untrusted taps; Control Center detects them and lets you trust a tap (and resume its updates) with one click, without requiring root

### 🤖 Agents

- **Local AI**: one switch runs a language model on this computer, served
  from a rootless container in your own account. The image is chosen from the
  graphics hardware that is actually present — NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or none —
  so every host gets a working answer. Nothing is layered onto the system
  image and nothing needs administrator authentication

### 🖥️ Bluefin, Bluefin LTS & Dakota

On [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), Bluefin LTS, and Dakota, Control Center adds
three switches ported from [bluefinctl](https://github.com/projectbluefin/bluefinctl).
Each hides itself on a system without `/usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json`,
so they cost nothing on Snow Linux or any other host.

- **Testing Channel**: Stage a `bootc switch` between the stable and testing
  release streams, then restart to apply. Control Center resolves the target
  reference from a per-image table rather than a tag suffix, so it never
  targets a tag the image does not publish — which also means the switch is
  correctly unavailable on Bluefin Stable's `latest`/`stable`/`gts`/`beta`
  streams, where no testing image exists. Downstream images add themselves
  through `channels.yml`; see [`channels.example.yml`](channels.example.yml)
- **Developer Mode**: Join the container, VM, and serial-device groups
  (`docker`, `incus-admin`, `libvirt`, `dialout`), effective at next login.
  This is group membership, not a rebase to a `-dx` image
- **Gaming Mode**: Install Steam, ProtonUp-Qt, Protontricks, MangoHud,
  GOverlay, and Flatseal as user Flatpaks — nothing is layered onto the system
  image, so a system update never has to reconcile it. MangoHud is a Vulkan
  layer extending the freedesktop runtime rather than an application, and is
  inventoried as such, so it is installed once and removed again with the
  rest of the stack

### 🔄 Unified Updates

The Updates page leads with the system's status — "System is up to date", or
how many updates are waiting — above an **Update sources** list of the four
things that can be updated: Applications, Developer tools, System components,
and Operating system. One primary action covers all of them: **Check again**
when nothing is pending, **Update all** when something is, **Retry failed**
when a source did not finish, and **Restart now** once an OS image is staged.
A source that fails does not stop the others, and the restart prompt appears
only when an image was actually staged, so a system that was already current
never asks for a reboot.

### 🔁 Automatic Updates & Rollback

- **Automatic Updates**: one switch for whether the system updates itself in
  the background. Hidden on systems without the unattended-update timer
- **Roll Back**: return to the previous system image at the next restart,
  shown only when a previous image exists

### 🎨 Livery

- **App Grid Livery**: your own mark on the Show Applications button —
  searchable across all 3,461 brands [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
  publishes, fetched on demand
- **Foundational Livery**: a mark in the top bar — CNCF, Linux Foundation,
  GNOME, freedesktop.org, Apache, Rust, Universal Blue, Bazzite, Aurora, or
  the Open Gaming Collective, which is the default on a gaming image
- **Dock Livery**: your CNCF project's own colour icon on the Files icon —
  search all 214 projects that publish artwork, from Kubernetes to bootc
- **Rotate at Login**: the two foundation sections can advance one step each
  time you sign in. Any section also accepts an SVG of your own

### 🔧 Updates & Maintenance

- **System Updates**: On bootc-based systems, download and stage the next OS image update (applied on restart) and view booted/staged/rollback deployment status; on native A/B (systemd-sysupdate) installs, stage the next image the same way and see the previous version available for boot-menu rollback
- **Update Now**: on hosts carrying the integrated updater, one row runs a
  full system update immediately instead of waiting for the background timer
- **Homebrew Updates**: Check for and install package updates; actions show
  progress, reject repeated clicks, and refresh the outdated rows and sidebar
  badge after successful live operations
- **Outdated Packages**: View and upgrade packages that have newer versions available
- **Free Up Space**: one button removes cached downloads and supporting
  software nothing uses any more, leaving your apps, files, and containers
  alone. It reports what each step actually did, and shows a reclaimed figure
  only when the measurement is trustworthy
- **Recovery**: Powerwash and Factory Reset, both irreversible, both
  confirmed, and both disabled until an administrator opts in

## Installation

### Installing a Release

Each [Control Center release](https://github.com/projectbluefin/chairlift/releases)
provides ready-to-install packages for 64-bit Intel/AMD and Arm systems.
Choose the package format for your distribution:

| Distribution family | Full-package filename | Install command |
|---|---|---|
| Debian/Ubuntu | `projectbluefin-chairlift_<version>_<arch>.deb` (`amd64` or `arm64`) | `sudo apt install ./<downloaded-filename>` |
| Fedora/RHEL | `projectbluefin-chairlift-<version>-1.<arch>.rpm` (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) | `sudo dnf install ./<downloaded-filename>` |
| Alpine | `projectbluefin-chairlift_<version>_<arch>.apk` (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) | `sudo apk add --allow-untrusted ./<downloaded-filename>` |

For a normal system installation, download the full `projectbluefin-chairlift`
package. It includes the GUI, both privileged helpers
(`/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper` and `/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`),
desktop assets, four PolicyKit policies, and package-maintainer configuration.

Use the similarly named `projectbluefin-chairlift-system-integration` package
**only** when the Control Center GUI is already delivered through a user-scoped
mechanism such as the Homebrew cask. That package supplies only the root-owned
helpers, policies, configuration, and channel-table example needed by such an
installation; it does not include the GUI. Never install both packages: they
intentionally conflict because they own the same system-integration files.

Download `checksums.txt` from the same release and verify the selected package
before installing it:

```bash
package='<downloaded-package-filename>'
grep -F "  $package" checksums.txt | sha256sum --check -
```

### Building from Source

ChairLift is written in Go using [puregotk](https://codeberg.org/puregotk/puregotk) bindings (no CGO required):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/projectbluefin/chairlift.git
cd chairlift

# Build
make build

# Binaries are written to build/:
#   build/chairlift                 the main application
#   build/chairlift-updex-helper    privileged helper for updex feature writes
#   build/chairlift-ublue-helper    privileged helper for Bluefin-family system writes

# Install (binaries, polkit policies, icons, desktop file)
sudo make install
```

`/usr` is the **only** supported `PREFIX` for an installation that
participates in PolicyKit authentication (`sudo make install` uses it by
default — no need to pass `PREFIX` explicitly). PolicyKit's `polkitd` reads
`.policy` files from the fixed system directory
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`, and `pkexec` matches each privileged executable
against the absolute path recorded in that action's
`org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path` annotation: `/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper`,
`/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`, `/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage`, or
`/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage`. The helper policies also select the
authorized subcommand through `org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.argv1`.
Installing under any other prefix places those files where polkit never looks
or where the helper paths no longer match, so the privileged updex,
Bluefin-family, bootc-staging, and sysupdate-staging features silently stop
working (or fall back to a more restrictive, always-reprompting authentication
rule). This also matches the layout used by ChairLift's full
`projectbluefin-chairlift` nFPM package, so a source install and a full
packaged install end up identical.

Control Center does not install passwordless PolicyKit rules. Bootc staging,
sysupdate staging, updex writes, and Bluefin-family system operations use the
policies' normal administrator-authentication defaults; an active session may
retain a successful authorization briefly. The updex helper accepts only
`enable-feature <name> [--dry-run]`, `disable-feature <name> [--dry-run]`, and
`update [--dry-run]`. The ublue helper accepts only `channel-switch
<stable|testing> [--dry-run]`, `dx-enable [--dry-run]`, `dx-disable
[--dry-run]`, `restart [--dry-run]`, `rollback [--dry-run]`,
`auto-updates-enable [--dry-run]`, `auto-updates-disable [--dry-run]`,
`driver-switch <standard|nvidia|nvidia-open> [--dry-run]`, and `factory-reset
[--dry-run]`. Both helpers reject every other
argument shape inside the privileged process.

Both paths install package-maintainer configuration defaults at
`/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml`. They never create or overwrite the
administrator-owned `/etc/chairlift/config.yml` override.

Releases also publish a small
`projectbluefin-chairlift-system-integration` deb/rpm/apk for distributions that
deliver the GUI through a user-scoped mechanism such as the Homebrew cask. It
installs the fixed helper binaries at `/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper` and
`/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`; the four policies
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.bootc.policy`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.sysupdate.policy`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.updex.policy`, and
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.ublue.policy`;
`/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml`; and the documented channel-table example at
`/usr/share/doc/chairlift/channels.example.yml`. It does not install the GUI.
The integration and full packages conflict intentionally because they own the
same privileged files.

The full `projectbluefin-chairlift` deb/rpm/apk declares its mandatory runtime
dependencies, per format, because distro package names differ: `bash` (the
`/usr/bin/chairlift-wrapper` launcher the desktop entry runs) plus the GTK4 and
Libadwaita runtime libraries — `libgtk-4-1`/`libadwaita-1-0` on deb,
`gtk4`/`libadwaita` on rpm, and `gtk4.0`/`libadwaita` on apk. The integration
package declares none: it ships no GUI, desktop entry, or wrapper script.

The bootc policy deliberately retains the fixed
`/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` path. A distribution must provide a trusted
stage helper at exactly that path before enabling `bootc_updates_group`; the
integration package does not provide a distro-specific staging implementation.
Control Center hides the group when the helper is absent. The sysupdate policy
likewise retains the fixed `/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` path used by
`sysupdate_updates_group` on native A/B installs; that helper (and the
`/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab` marker gating the group) ship with the OS image.

`PREFIX` can still be overridden (e.g. `make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local`)
for a non-privileged, non-PolicyKit-integrated install — but the helper
binaries, bootc staging, and sysupdate staging will not resolve to their fixed
exec-path annotations in that case.

`DESTDIR` layers underneath `PREFIX` as usual, unchanged by any of the
above, for staged/packaged installs (`make install DESTDIR=/path/to/stage
PREFIX=/usr`) — this is what `.goreleaser.yaml`'s nFPM packaging uses.

**Migrating from a prior `/usr/local` source install:** `PREFIX` used to
default to `/usr/local`. Before reinstalling at the new `/usr` default,
remove the old install with `sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/usr/local`.

Other useful targets: `make dev` (CGO-enabled build with `-race` for development), `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make build-linux-amd64` / `make build-linux-arm64` (cross-compilation), `make uninstall`.

### Dependencies

- Go (see `go.mod` for the toolchain version)
- GTK 4 and libadwaita 1 (shared libraries, loaded at runtime by puregotk — no GTK dev headers or CGO needed to build; declared as a mandatory runtime dependency of the published deb/rpm/apk packages)
- Bash (required by the `chairlift-wrapper` launcher script the packaged desktop entry invokes)
- Homebrew (optional, for package management features and tap trust)
- Flatpak (optional)
- `bootc` and the snow `/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` script (optional; enables staged system updates on bootc installs)
- The snow `/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` script and `/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab` marker (optional; enables staged system updates on native A/B installs)
- `updex` features configured on the system (optional; toggled via the Features page)
- Podman (optional; runs the Agents page's local model container)
- The `uupd.timer` systemd unit (optional; backs the automatic-updates switch, whose state `internal/autoupdate` reads and whose enable/mask the ublue helper performs — ChairLift never executes the `uupd` binary itself)

---

## Usage

Launch Control Center from your application menu or run:

```bash
chairlift
```

### Main Sections

1. **Updates**: Update everything in one action or per provider — stage bootc
   or native A/B system updates, apply Flatpak updates, manage Homebrew
   updates and outdated packages, trust Homebrew taps, read the system
   version, and switch release channel or graphics-driver variant
2. **Apps**: Manage installed Homebrew packages, search for formulae and
   casks, install app collections, and launch the configured external Flatpak
   manager
3. **Agents**: Run a language model on this computer
4. **Features**: Enable, disable, and update configured system features, plus
   Developer Mode, Gaming Mode, and Enhanced Troubleshooting
5. **Livery**: Choose the icons shown on the app-grid button, the top-bar menu,
   and Files — a personal brand from Simple Icons, a foundation mark, or a CNCF
   project's artwork, optionally advancing at each login
6. **Maintenance**: Free up space, run administrator-configured maintenance
   scripts, and — where an administrator has opted in — Powerwash or Factory
   Reset
7. **Help**: Documentation and support resources

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Alt+1` through `Alt+N`: open the first through Nth visible page in sidebar
  order. Pages whose configurable groups are all disabled are omitted, so the
  numbers compact without gaps; Help is always retained.
- `F1`: open Help
- `Ctrl+?`: show the keyboard-shortcuts window
- `Ctrl+Q`: quit

Mouse and keyboard navigation have identical behavior in a collapsed window:
selecting a destination reveals its content as well as updating the selected
sidebar row and page title.

### Managing Packages

- **Browse Installed**: Navigate to Apps → Brew Packages to see all installed formulae and casks
- **Search**: Use the search box to find packages by name or keyword
- **Install**: Click the install button next to search results or collection rows
- **Pin/Unpin**: Use the formula row's Pin or Unpin action and confirm the change
- **Remove**: Use an installed formula or cask row's Uninstall action and
  confirm the removal
- **Upgrade**: Click upgrade button next to outdated packages

Control Center lists and uninstalls installed user and system Flatpak applications,
but delegates discovery and installation of new Flatpaks to the external
manager configured by
`applications_page.applications_installed_group.app_id` (Bazaar by default).

### App Collections

The Apps page discovers curated `*.Brewfile` collections from every directory
configured in `applications_page.brew_bundles_group.bundles_paths`
(`/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew` by default). Each row is named and described
from a curated table rather than from the file, because the shipped
collections are identified on disk by tooling names such as `cli` and
`system-flatpaks`; a collection that table does not know gets a readable form
of its identifier, and its leading `#` comment only when that comment reads
as a human sentence. Every row states how many apps and tools it installs.
Missing directories are harmless, while unreadable configured paths are
logged without hiding collections found elsewhere. Repeated clicks cannot
start overlapping installs, and `--dry-run` shows a preview without leaving
the row marked as installed.

---

## Configuration

Control Center is highly configurable and can be adapted for different Linux distributions. The application uses a YAML configuration file to control which features are displayed and which applications are launched for various system management tasks.

### Making Control Center Portable

While Control Center was designed for Snow Linux, it can be easily customized for other distributions by:

- **Disabling Snow-specific features**: Hide Homebrew package management if your distribution doesn't use it
- **Customizing system tools**: Configure which application to launch for Flatpak discovery and installation
- **Setting help resources**: Point users to your distribution's documentation, issue tracker, and community chat

### Configuration File

See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for detailed documentation on:

- Available configuration options
- How to show/hide specific feature groups
- Customizing application launchers
- Setting up help resource URLs
- Example configurations for non-Snow distributions

Configuration files are searched in the following locations (in order):

1. `/etc/chairlift/config.yml` (system-wide - highest priority)
2. `/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml` (package maintainer defaults)
3. `config.dev.yml` beside the ChairLift executable, or in the current working
   directory when no executable-relative file exists (source-checkout fallback)
4. `config.yml` beside the ChairLift executable, or in the current working
   directory when no executable-relative file exists (legacy development fallback)

Only the first two locations are trusted: `sudo: true` actions are accepted
only from them, and an untrusted file may not enable a group whose effective
actions include a privileged one, even when it inherits that action from the
built-in defaults. See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for the full rule.

The first file that exists is authoritative. If it is unreadable, malformed,
or contains unknown pages, groups, fields, or invalid field types, Control Center
does not use a lower-priority file: it hides every configurable feature group,
logs a `CONFIGURATION ERROR`, and shows a persistent error toast with the path
and cause. Fix the file and restart Control Center. If every candidate is absent,
the built-in defaults apply.

### Key Components

See [docs/design/overview.md](docs/design/overview.md) and [docs/design/package-managers.md](docs/design/package-managers.md) for detailed architecture notes (written for AI-assisted development, but equally useful as a deep-dive for humans); [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) indexes the full documentation tree.

- **`internal/homebrew`**: Homebrew CLI wrapper — package listing/searching, install/uninstall, pin/unpin, bundles, updates, and Homebrew 6 tap-trust detection/management
- **`internal/bootc`**: bootc status reads and pkexec-driven update staging via the snow `bootc-update-stage` script
- **`internal/sysupdate`**: native A/B (systemd-sysupdate) status reads from the `/run/snosi` state files, rollback-candidate discovery from partition labels, and pkexec-driven update staging via the snow `snosi-sysupdate-stage` script
- **`internal/views`**: GTK4/Adwaita UI — async operations dispatched via `sgtk.RunOnMainThread`, toast notifications for user feedback
- **`internal/views/pageview`**: pure-Go row text, page status, os-release parsing, help-link ordering, and maintenance-command selection shared by all seven page builders

### Development Environment

- **Build**: `make build` (see [Building from Source](#building-from-source) above)
- **Containerized dev environment**: `distrobox.ini` describes a Debian Trixie container with the runtime and build dependencies; use `distrobox assemble create --file distrobox.ini` (or your preferred distrobox workflow) to create it, then `distrobox enter chairlift` and run `make build`/`make dev` inside. It mounts `/home/linuxbrew` (for Homebrew integration testing) and `/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew` (for app-collection testing) from the host.

### Testing

Run `make ci` before pushing; it mirrors the hosted verify, lint, unit, race,
and cross-architecture build gates. Run `make e2e` on a host with GTK4,
Libadwaita, `dbus-run-session`, and Xvfb to execute the built application's
help path, start its dry-run window in a private headless session, poll bounded
startup readiness, stage the complete install layout, and exercise the installed
privileged helper's argument rejection. The hosted E2E job installs those
runtime dependencies and runs the same target. The unit gate also scans every
workflow and rejects external GitHub Actions references that are not pinned to
full commit SHAs.

Codecov rejects project coverage regressions greater than one percentage point.
Coverage expectations otherwise remain risk-based, not a repository-wide
percentage target: command wrappers must cover argument construction, dry-run,
parsing, and failure propagation; configuration and privileged paths must keep
exhaustive consistency tests; and GTK-independent view state belongs in
headlessly tested leaf packages. `internal/views/pageview` table-tests the
shared presentation decisions for every page and statically verifies each
builder uses them. The puregotk-importing `internal/app`,
`internal/window`, and `internal/views` packages intentionally remain
test-binary-free because ordinary unit-test hosts lack GTK libraries; the E2E
suite tests them only by executing the already-built application.
