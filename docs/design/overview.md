# ChairLift Overview

Living design document (formerly `yeti/OVERVIEW.md`; folded into `docs/` per
[frostyard/core ADR-0025](https://github.com/frostyard/core/blob/main/docs/adr/0025-consolidate-repository-docs-into-docs.md)).

## Purpose

ChairLift is a GTK4/Libadwaita system management GUI for [Snow Linux](https://github.com/frostyard/snosi), written in Go using [puregotk](https://codeberg.org/puregotk/puregotk) bindings (no CGO). It provides a unified interface for managing Homebrew and Flatpak applications, OS system updates (staged via the snow `bootc-update-stage` script on bootc installs, or the snow `snosi-sysupdate-stage` script on native A/B installs), system features (via updex), and maintenance tasks. The UI is YAML-configuration-driven, making it portable to other Linux distributions by toggling feature groups on/off.

### Dependency flow

`cmd → app → window → views → {config, launcher, homebrew, flatpak, bootc, sysupdate, updex}`.
`app` and `window` also depend on the pure `navigation` package.

External shared library: `github.com/frostyard/snowkit` (published module, pinned in go.mod) provides:

- `gobj` — GObject type registration and instance registry
- `sgtk.RunOnMainThread()` — main-thread dispatch for GTK safety

### Views coordinator (`internal/views/views.go`)

The `views.go` file defines the central `UserHome` struct that holds references to all page widgets, config, and the `ToastAdder` interface. It provides:

- `New(cfg, toastAdder)` — constructor that initializes `UserHome`
- `ToastAdder` interface — `ShowToast(msg)`, `ShowErrorToast(msg)`, `SetUpdateBadge(count)` — implemented by Window

`internal/views` imports puregotk, so it can never hold a `_test.go` (see `docs/skills/gtk-headless-testing/SKILL.md`). Decidable logic is therefore pushed down into twelve puregotk-free leaf packages beneath it — `internal/views/actionmsg` and `internal/views/trustmsg` (toast text and UI decisions, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-toast-and-decision-helpers-internalviewsactionmsg-internalviewstrustmsg)), `internal/views/actionstate` (Homebrew update command/refresh outcomes and repeated-click gates, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-update-action-state-internalviewsactionstate)), `internal/views/badgestate` (thread-safe per-provider update counts and totals, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-update-badge-state-internalviewsbadgestate)), `internal/views/bundleview` (the app-collection naming catalog plus empty/error/unavailable presentation and per-row install gating, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-brew-bundle-state-internalviewsbundleview)), `internal/views/cleanupview` (the Maintenance page's free-space wording, per-step result summarisation, and the free-space measurement it will and will not report), `internal/views/rowset` (single-row removal, clear-then-repopulate bookkeeping, plus the `TrimTo` rolling-window eviction a bounded log needs, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-row-bookkeeping-internalviewsrowset)), `internal/views/progresslog` (coalescing streamed staging output into bounded main-thread batches, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-bounded-staging-output-internalviewsprogresslog)), `internal/views/flatpakstatus` (the Flatpak updates expander's subtitle text and expandable decision, applied by `loadFlatpakUpdates` from both retained `ListUpdates` errors, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-flatpak-update-status-internalviewsflatpakstatus)), `internal/views/featurestatus` (the Features page's per-feature update-status subtitle, the any-component update decision and the features group description for check outcomes — `GroupDescriptionCheckFailed` when the check itself failed, `GroupDescriptionIncomplete` when the check was incomplete or returned warnings, and `GroupDescription` when it completed with zero features updatable or with updates found — applied by `checkFeatureUpdates`, which composes no subtitle or description text of its own, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-feature-update-status-internalviewsfeaturestatus)), `internal/views/updatepresent` (the unified update shell's aggregate icon, title, description, and action metadata, derived from one `updateflow.Snapshot`), and `internal/views/pageview` (the row text, page status, os-release parsing, Help resource ordering, and maintenance-command selection shared by all seven page builders, see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-page-presentation-internalviewspageview)) — each table- or scenario-tested headlessly. This layout is decision record
[ADR-0007](../adr/0007-pure-leaf-packages-route-around-untestable-gtk.md).

### Pages

The UI defines seven pages, each in its own file under `internal/views/`.
`internal/navigation` holds the canonical order below and the sidebar titles;
static configuration may omit any functional page whose builder-backed groups
are all disabled, and Help is always retained:

| Page         | File                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Updates      | `updates_page.go` + `update_shell.go` | The whole update story: the status-first update shell (`internal/updateflow`), the automatic-updates switch, bootc or native A/B (systemd-sysupdate) staged system updates, Flatpak updates, Homebrew outdated packages, untrusted-tap trust prompts, the system-version readout, and release-channel/graphics-driver switching |
| Apps         | `applications_page.go` | Manage Homebrew formulae/casks and installed Flatpaks; install app collections; launch an external manager for new Flatpak installs                                                   |
| Agents       | `agents_page.go`       | One unprivileged switch running a language model in a rootless container in the invoking account (`internal/aistack`)                                                                 |
| Features     | `features_page.go`     | Updex feature toggles plus Developer Mode, Gaming Mode, and Enhanced Troubleshooting                                                                                                  |
| Livery       | `livery_page.go`       | App-grid, panel, and Files marks, by shadowing icon-theme names in the user's own theme (`internal/livery`)                                                                           |
| Maintenance  | `maintenance_page.go`  | One "Free up space" action, administrator-configured maintenance scripts (executed via `exec.Command`/`pkexec`), and the opt-in Recovery group                                        |
| Help         | `help_page.go`         | Configurable links to the website, issue tracker, and documentation (opened via `xdg-open`)                                                                           |

The sidebar title for `applications_page` is "Apps", not "Applications";
`internal/navigation` owns that distinction and `internal/window` reads it.

## Key Patterns

### GObject registration via snowkit

Application and Window are registered as GObject subtypes using `gobj.RegisterType()`. This returns a `gobject.Type` and an `*gobj.InstanceRegistry`. The pattern:

1. `init()` registers the type with `ClassInit` callback
2. `ClassInit` overrides `Constructed` to create the Go struct and pin it in the registry
3. Constructor (`New()`) calls `gobject.NewObject()` then retrieves the Go instance from the registry

See `internal/app/app.go` and `internal/window/window.go`.

### Async operations with main-thread dispatch

All external tool calls run in goroutines. UI updates are marshaled back via `sgtk.RunOnMainThread()`:

```go
go func() {
    result, err := homebrew.ListInstalledFormulae()
    sgtk.RunOnMainThread(func() {
        // update widgets here
    })
}()
```

### Deferred visibility (async startup)

To avoid blocking startup on slow tool-availability checks, groups that depend on optional tools (Homebrew, Flatpak, Updex) are built immediately with placeholder descriptions and then shown or hidden asynchronously. The pattern:

1. Build the UI group unconditionally (if config-enabled), with a placeholder description
2. Store a reference to the group on `UserHome` (e.g., `featuresGroup`)
3. Spawn a goroutine that calls `IsInstalledCached()` (see below)
4. On the main thread, either hide the group (`SetVisible(false)`) or update its description

This applies to: `featuresGroup`/`featuresUnavailableGroup` and the Updates page's automatic-updates group. The Features page uses a dual-group approach — one for available features, one for "not available" — toggling visibility between them. The Maintenance page no longer uses it: its one cleanup action is always shown, because which package managers are installed is the cleanup runner's business and not something a user should have to learn from a group appearing or disappearing.

The automatic-updates group (`automatic_updates_group`, `internal/views/automatic_updates.go`) is the one place the *startup* path must not probe at all. Whether it has anything to show depends on `systemctl is-enabled`/`is-active` for `uupd.timer`, two queries that can each approach a multi-second timeout on a slow or wedged host. `buildAutomaticUpdatesGroup` therefore adds an empty, hidden group and returns; `loadAutomaticUpdatesGroup` runs `autoupdate.Detect` in a worker under a five-second `autoUpdateProbeTimeout`; and `buildAutomaticUpdatesRow` marshals the switch back onto the GTK main thread and reveals the group only once the probe has answered. A host with no unattended-update timer never sees a switch that would do nothing — the group simply stays hidden (chairlift#79).

### bootc boot gate

bootc-related UI groups (the Updates page's `bootc_status_group` and `bootc_updates_group`) are gated on `bootc.IsBootcBootedCached()`, which runs `bootc status --format json` once (via `sync.Once`) and reports true only when the parsed `status.booted` field is non-null. This is deliberately not a sentinel-file check: `/run/ostree-booted` is absent on snow's composefs-based deployments, so relying on it would hide the groups on every snow bootc host. `bootc status` itself exits 0 with a null `booted` entry on non-bootc hosts, so the gate must inspect the JSON body rather than the exit code.

### Native A/B gate

The updates page's `sysupdate_updates_group` is gated on `sysupdate.IsNativeABCached()` (an `os.Stat` of `/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab`, cached via `sync.Once`) plus `sysupdate.StageScriptAvailable()` (`/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` exists). Unlike the bootc case, a marker-file check is correct here: the marker is snosi's own published contract for "this host updates via systemd-sysupdate" — every snosi unit and script gates on it (`ConditionPathExists=/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab`) — whereas `/run/ostree-booted` was a foreign sentinel that snow's bootc deployments never wrote. The `bootc` binary is absent on native A/B images and `os-release`'s `IMAGE_ID` is identical across both variants, so neither is usable for this gate. The two OS-update gates are mutually exclusive at runtime: at most one "System Updates" group ever becomes visible even though both may be config-enabled and built.

### Dry-run mode

Decision record: [ADR-0009](../adr/0009-dry-run-output-convention-and-single-decision-structs.md)
(the `[DRY-RUN]` output convention and single decision structs).

`internal/dryrun` (`internal/dryrun/dryrun.go`) is the single process-wide preview-mode authority. `app.New()` calls `dryrun.Set(true)` once at startup when `--dry-run`/`-d` is passed, and every integration — homebrew, flatpak, bootc, sysupdate, updex, and `internal/views` itself (for configured custom maintenance scripts, which have no wrapper package of their own) — reads `dryrun.Enabled()` rather than keeping a flag of its own.

**The general rule, applied uniformly:** every state-changing view handler branches on `dryrun.Enabled()` to show an explicit preview toast instead of a completed/saved/installed message. Anywhere that same handler would _also_ mutate a row, a group's visibility, or a switch on success, that mutation decision is pulled out of the view and expressed as a small struct or an `actionstate.Decision` — `ScriptDecision.Execute`, `BundleInstallDecision.Complete`, `TapTrustDecision.MutateUI`, `FeatureToggleDecision.Confirm`, `PackageInstall`, `PackageUninstall`, or `PackagePin`. The view computes `dryrun.Enabled()` exactly once, builds the decision, and branches solely on it for both the mutation _and_ the toast, so a table-driven test proves the mutation gate and the toast cannot drift from it (see [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#view-layer-toast-and-decision-helpers-internalviewsactionmsg-internalviewstrustmsg) for the full function/type list). Sites with no second UI mutation to gate (package upgrade/update/self-update, Flatpak uninstall, cleanup, Brewfile dump, bootc stage, and feature-update toasts) get a plain string function instead.

**Intentional exception:** bootc staging's completion **toast** is dry-run-aware (`actionmsg.BootcStage`), but its expander **subtitle** deliberately is not. The subtitle is a persistent status readout of live `bootc.GetStatus()` — what deployment is actually staged/booted right now — not a per-click completion claim, so it stays accurate and unchanged in both dry-run and live mode. Only the toast, which inherently answers "what did this click just do," needed dry-run-specific wording; there is no mutation left to gate once the subtitle is deliberately excluded, which is why `BootcStage` is string-only rather than a decision struct. Native A/B staging follows the identical split: `actionmsg.SysupdateStage` is the dry-run-aware toast, while the subtitle and rollback row re-read the real `/run/snosi` state files and partition labels in both modes.

Per-wrapper mechanics:

- **Homebrew/Flatpak**: state-changing commands are skipped entirely at the wrapper layer (return mock/empty results); ordinary package-action toasts use the plain `actionmsg` string functions (`Install`, `Uninstall`, `Pin`, `Upgrade`, `Update`, `SelfUpdate`, `BundleDump`, `Cleanup`). Homebrew search installs and installed-package uninstall/pin actions pair that text with `actionstate` decisions: live success completes the old row controls and refreshes the installed inventory, while failure or dry-run restores the controls. Brew bundle installation uses `BundleInstallDecision` with the same live-complete/dry-run-reset distinction.
- **Updex**: `EnableFeature`/`DisableFeature`/`UpdateFeatures` skip their `pkexec` call entirely under dry-run and return empty/nil results; the helper binary itself (`cmd/chairlift-updex-helper`, dispatch logic in `internal/updexhelper`) also honors `--dry-run` for `update`, matching `enable-feature`/`disable-feature`, as defense-in-depth even though it's unreachable from the wrapper today.
- **bootc**: `StageUpdate` short-circuits before invoking pkexec: it logs the would-be command, emits a synthetic `EventMessage` + `EventComplete` pair on the progress channel, and returns — the stage script is never actually run (see the exception above for the toast/subtitle split).
- **sysupdate**: `StageUpdate` has the same shape as bootc's — under dry-run it logs the would-be `pkexec /usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` command, emits the synthetic `EventMessage` + `EventComplete` pair, and never constructs an `exec.Cmd`. Status reads (`GetStatus`, `RollbackVersion`) are not dry-run-gated: they are unprivileged, side-effect-free reads of real state.
- **Homebrew tap trust**: `trustTap` (`internal/views/updates_page.go`) computes `decision := actionmsg.TapTrust(dryrun.Enabled(), tap.Name)` once, after a successful `homebrew.TrustPackages` call, and gates removing the tap's row, hiding the group, and refreshing outdated packages on `decision.MutateUI`.
- **views (custom maintenance scripts)**: `runMaintenanceAction` (`internal/views/maintenance_page.go`) calls `actionmsg.MaintenanceScript(dryrun.Enabled(), title)` once, before spawning its goroutine, to get a `ScriptDecision{Execute, Toast}`: when `Execute` is false no `exec.Cmd` is ever constructed (no `pkexec`, no direct script exec) — only a `[DRY-RUN] Would execute: ...` log line.
- **Features page switch confirmation**: `onFeatureToggled` (`internal/views/features_page.go`) computes `decision := actionmsg.FeatureToggle(dryrun.Enabled(), enabled, name)` once, after a successful `updex.EnableFeature`/`DisableFeature` call, and branches solely on `decision.Confirm` to decide whether the switch confirms the flip (`toggle.SetActive(enabled)`) or reverts to its pre-click state (`toggle.SetActive(!enabled)`).

### Configuration-driven UI visibility

Each preference group on every page checks `config.IsGroupEnabled(pageName, groupName)` before building its widgets. Groups default to enabled if not specified in config. Both `maintenance_cleanup_group` and `reset_group` default to disabled in the default config.

`internal/config/config.go` builds the effective `*Config` by overlaying a
parsed file onto `defaultConfig()` field by field, not by replacing it
wholesale — `mergeConfig` walks each page, `mergePage` walks each group within
a page, and `mergeGroup` walks each field within a group. The overlay is
driven by `rawConfig`/`rawPageConfig`/`rawGroupConfig`, a pointer-typed mirror
of `Config`/`PageConfig`/`GroupConfig` used only for YAML decoding: a `nil`
pointer means the file omitted (or explicitly nulled) that key, so
`defaultConfig()`'s value survives; a non-nil pointer means the file set that
key — including to an empty string or empty slice — so it replaces the
default outright. This is why `maintenance_cleanup_group` stays disabled
overall (and keeps its default `actions` entry) when a config file mentions
the group only to flip an unrelated field. When every search candidate is
absent, `Load()` returns `defaultConfig()`. An authoritative file that cannot
be read or validated instead returns `disabledConfig()`: the same defaults
for non-visibility fields, with every canonical group's `Enabled` field
forced to false.

**Structured load-error vocabulary (`internal/config/loaderror.go`).** A
stable `ErrorKind` enumerates why loading/validating a config file could
fail: `KindRead` ("read") for a filesystem/read failure (e.g. permission
denied opening the file — distinct from "file does not exist", which
`Load()` treats as absent-and-fall-back, not an error); `KindParseType`
("parse/type") for a YAML syntax error, a value that decodes to the wrong
Go type, or a malformed source graph detected by pure shape/graph
inspection after the YAML parsed successfully (an unsupported node shape,
an alias with no target, an alias cycle, etc.) — like `KindSchema` below,
that shape-inspection case may legitimately carry a nil `Err`, since there
is no underlying parser error to wrap; and `KindSchema` ("schema") for a
validator-detected shape failure
found only after the document parsed successfully — e.g. an unknown key or a
value of the right YAML kind but the wrong shape — which may legitimately
carry a nil `Err` since shape inspection alone can detect the problem with
no underlying cause to wrap. `LoadError.Error()` renders `Path`, the exact
`Kind` string, `Detail`, and the cause (in that order, each only when
non-empty/non-nil), so the three `Kind` literals above always appear
verbatim in the message. `LoadError.Unwrap()` returns `Err` unchanged
(nil when there is none), which is what lets `errors.Is`/`errors.As` see
through a `*LoadError` to a wrapped sentinel or recover the original value
from a `fmt.Errorf("%w", ...)` wrapper.

**Single-document YAML parsing (`internal/config/source.go`).** The
unexported `parseYAMLDocument(path string, data []byte) (*yaml.Node,
*LoadError)` is the first thing in this package that actually constructs a
`LoadError`. It decodes `data` with `yaml.NewDecoder` and accepts exactly one
YAML document, with a fixed cardinality outcome per input shape:

- Empty input, and whitespace-only input, are both the valid empty result:
  `(nil, nil)` — no document, no error. This matches `Load()`'s existing
  "absent config" fallback semantics elsewhere in the package.
- A single well-formed document returns its `*yaml.Node` (`Kind ==
yaml.DocumentNode`, one child under `Content`) and a nil `*LoadError`.
- A malformed first document returns `(nil, err)` with `err.Kind ==
KindParseType`, `err.Path` copied verbatim, `err.Err` set to yaml.v3's own
  parser error, and `err.Detail` set to that same error's message — which
  yaml.v3 always renders as `"yaml: line N: ..."`, so the reported line is
  visible in `Detail` without a second look at `Err`.
- A trailing bare `---` is a second document, not a harmless end-of-stream
  marker: yaml.v3 decodes it as a second, null document, and
  `parseYAMLDocument` rejects it exactly like any other second document
  (`KindParseType`, `Detail` naming its line) rather than accepting the
  input as a single document.
- Any other second document — well-formed or malformed — is rejected the
  same way: a well-formed second document has no parser error to wrap, so
  `Err` is left nil and `Detail` names that document's own starting line
  instead; a malformed second document preserves _that_ document's parser
  error and line in `Err`/`Detail`, just like a malformed first document
  would.

These capabilities are now the runtime loading path:
`Load`/`loadFromPath` → `loadResolvedPath` → `parseAndValidate` →
`parseYAMLDocument`/`resolveEffective`/`validateSourceGraph`. Read failures
produce `KindRead`; malformed or wrong-type YAML produces `KindParseType`;
unknown schema names and invalid shapes produce `KindSchema`. No runtime
load uses the old permissive `yaml.Unmarshal` path.

**Exact merge-key recognition and tag normalization
(`internal/config/sourcegraph.go`).** `isMergeKey(n *yaml.Node) bool` and
`shortYAMLTag(tag string) string` are deliberate behaviorally exact reproductions
of two unexported predicates from `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` v3.0.1 itself —
`decode.go:isMerge` and `resolve.go:shortTag` — rather than reimplementations
from a description of YAML merge-key semantics, so this package's own
merge-key walk (`effectiveEntries`, described below) recognizes exactly the
same nodes yaml.v3's own decoder would treat as a merge key, node for node.
`isMergeKey` reports
true only for a `yaml.ScalarNode` whose `Value` is exactly `"<<"` and whose
`Tag` is one of: absent (`""`, the implicit/unresolved tag), the bare
non-specific tag (`"!"`), the short merge tag (`"!!merge"`), or its canonical
long form (`"tag:yaml.org,2002:merge"`) — the last two both recognized via
`shortYAMLTag`. A quoted `"<<"` (explicitly tagged `"!!str"`) is therefore an
ordinary key, not a merge key, and so is a merge-tagged scalar whose `Value`
isn't literally `"<<"`; non-scalar nodes (mapping, sequence, alias) and a nil
`*yaml.Node` are never merge keys either — `isMergeKey` is nil-safe rather
than panicking. `shortYAMLTag` rewrites a canonical `"tag:yaml.org,2002:xxx"`
tag to yaml.v3's short `"!!xxx"` form and returns any tag without that prefix
unchanged (including the empty tag, `"!"`, an already-short `"!!xxx"` tag, a
custom `"!xxx"` tag, and a long tag under a different authority such as
`"tag:example.com,2020:merge"`). These are the only two unexported helpers in
this package's source-graph slice that the spec singles out for a direct
unit test (`TestMergeKeyRecognition`, `TestShortYAMLTagNormalization` in
`sourcegraph_test.go`) rather than only exercising them through an exported
entry point, per
`docs/skills/helper-test-surface/SKILL.md`; neither
helper is called directly by runtime loading, but both are reached indirectly
through `resolveEffective` in the strict validator pipeline.

**Reachable source-graph shape validation
(`internal/config/sourcegraph.go`).** `validateSourceGraph(path string, doc
*yaml.Node) *LoadError` walks every node and content edge reachable from
`doc` — through document content, mapping keys, mapping values, sequence
entries, and alias targets, in each node's `Content` slice order — and
rejects a malformed source graph as `KindParseType` rather than panicking,
even against a synthetic `*yaml.Node` tree unreachable from real YAML text.
`doc == nil` succeeds unconditionally: it is `parseYAMLDocument`'s valid
empty-input result. Otherwise the checks are, in order:

- the root must be a `yaml.DocumentNode` with exactly one non-nil child;
- every reachable mapping must have an even number of content entries, and
  neither a key nor a value in any key/value pair may be nil;
- every reachable sequence must have no nil entries;
- every reachable scalar must have no content children;
- every reachable alias must have no content children and a non-nil
  `Alias` target; and
- every reachable node's `Kind` must be one of yaml.v3's five supported
  kinds (an all-zero `Kind` or any other unsupported value is rejected).

Node identity — the `*yaml.Node` pointer itself, not any decoded value —
drives an unseen/visiting/done state map keyed on that pointer, so a node
reached through several parents (a shared anchor aliased more than once, a
scalar reused as several mapping values) is validated exactly once, and
re-encountering a node still in the `visiting` state on the active
depth-first path is rejected as an alias cycle (covering both a self cycle,
where an anchored mapping's own value aliases back to itself, and a mutual
cycle between two anchored mappings). Because pure shape/graph rejections
have no underlying Go error to preserve, every `*LoadError` `validateSourceGraph`
returns carries a nil `Err`; `LoadError.Error()` still renders the full
`"config parse/type error: <path>: <detail>"` wording from `Path` and
`Detail` alone. A self merge (`&a {<<: *a}`) and a mutual merge cycle
between two anchored mappings are both rejected too, but as a byproduct of
the same generic alias-cycle rule above rather than merge-specific code: the
merge operand's alias is still in the `visiting` state by the time any
merge-shape check would run, so the cycle rule fires first. Every reachable
mapping's explicit keys must also be pairwise unique (see the duplicate-key
paragraph below); the memoized 64-consecutive-alias-hop bound and the
memoized 128-source-node-path-visit bound, both described below, now run
as a second pass once these checks prove the graph acyclic.
Runtime loading reaches `validateSourceGraph` through
`parseAndValidate` → `resolveEffective`.

**Merge-operand shape validation (`internal/config/sourcegraph.go`).**
Layered onto the traversal above: every mapping entry whose key
`isMergeKey` reports true additionally has its value checked as a merge
operand by `validateMergeOperand`, reproducing `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` v3.0.1
`decode.go`'s `merge`/`failWantMap` rule exactly rather than accepting any
value ordinary YAML content would allow. A merge operand is accepted only
as one of: a `yaml.MappingNode` literal; a `yaml.AliasNode` whose
_immediate_ `Alias` target is a `yaml.MappingNode`; or a `yaml.SequenceNode`
each of whose entries is itself one of the two prior shapes. Everything
else is rejected as `KindParseType` — a scalar operand, an alias to a
sequence or a scalar, a sequence containing a scalar or a nested sequence,
and a sequence containing an alias to a non-mapping all fail
(`isMergeOperandMapping` is the single-alias-hop predicate both the direct
and sequence-entry checks share). The immediate-target rule produces a
deliberate asymmetry: an alias-to-alias-to-mapping chain is perfectly valid
as an _ordinary_ mapping value (the generic traversal above only requires a
non-nil `Alias` target of any kind) but is rejected as a merge operand,
because yaml.v3 itself only unwraps one alias hop before deciding a merge
value is not a mapping. All four of `isMergeKey`'s recognized tag forms —
implicit, `"!"`, `"!!merge"`, and the canonical long tag — trigger this
check identically; a quoted `"<<"` key (tagged `"!!str"`) does not, so it
may hold any otherwise-valid value, including a bare scalar. Merge operands
are validated wherever the traversal reaches them — inside a complex
mapping key's own subtree (complex keys are traversed like any other node
but are not otherwise classified in this slice), and in a mapping entry a
later, still-unimplemented merge-precedence pass would go on to discard in
favor of a later `<<` entry — because this function proves every reachable
node well-formed, not just the nodes an eventual effective-merge result
would keep
(`docs/skills/merge-validation/SKILL.md`).

**Duplicate explicit-key detection (`internal/config/sourcegraph.go`).**
Every reachable mapping's explicit keys must be pairwise unique under
`sourceKeyID{Kind, Value}` identity — a repeated key rejects the whole
graph as `KindParseType`, naming the duplicated key's value and, when the
parser recorded a positive line for it, that line. The identity
deliberately compares only `Kind` and `Value`, reproducing `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
v3.0.1 `decode.go`'s own `uniqueKeys` predicate (inside `decoder.mapping`)
exactly rather than the tag-aware key identity
`docs/skills/yaml-key-identity/SKILL.md`
requires elsewhere in this package for merge-precedence purposes — that rule
is about a different concern (`effectiveKeyIdentity`, described just below)
and does not apply here, because yaml.v3's own duplicate-key guard never
looks at `Tag` either. Two surprising consequences follow directly: two
`<<` merge-key entries in the same mapping collide as duplicates regardless
of which of `isMergeKey`'s four accepted tag forms each carries (an
implicit `<<` and one explicitly tagged `!!merge` are still "the same key"),
and a bare `1` (yaml.v3 resolves it to `!!int`) collides with an explicitly
quoted `"1"` (`!!str`) even though their `Tag`s differ, because neither
`Kind` nor `Value` distinguishes them. Detection is per-mapping, not
global — the same key value recurring in a sibling mapping, or in a nested
mapping reachable through it, is never a duplicate — and it runs on every
reachable mapping regardless of how it is reached: directly, as a merge
operand's value, through an alias target, or inside a complex mapping key's
own subtree. The implementation is one `map[sourceKeyID]struct{}` per
mapping, sized from `len(n.Content)/2`, filled by a single linear pass over
key indices — deliberately not yaml.v3's own nested-loop `uniqueKeys`
comparison, which is pairwise (`O(k^2)` per mapping). This package's version
is `O(k)` per mapping and `O(V+E)` over the whole graph, so a mapping with
tens of thousands of keys does not make the validator's own running time
blow up the way the pairwise loop would.

**Effective (merge-precedence) key identity
(`internal/config/effectivekeys.go`).** A separate, standalone helper,
`effectiveKeyIdentity`, computes a comparable `effectiveKeyID` for a mapping
key node — the identity the merge-precedence resolver `effectiveEntries`
(`internal/config/effectivemerge.go`, described below) uses to decide
whether two keys from different merge sources are "the same key" and must
therefore resolve to one effective value rather than two. It is
deliberately a different type and a different comparison from
`sourceKeyID` above: `effectiveKeyIdentity` first follows `n`'s
`yaml.AliasNode` chain (any number of hops, guarded by a local
node-pointer seen-set so a synthetic self-referential alias handed to it
directly terminates instead of hanging) to its non-alias target, then
branches on that target's `Kind`. A `yaml.ScalarNode` target yields `{kind:
yaml.ScalarNode, tag: target.ShortTag(), value: target.Value}` —
`ShortTag()` is used rather than the raw `Tag` field because
`gopkg.in/yaml.v3` v3.0.1's `yaml.go` implements it to resolve an unset or
`"!"` tag from the node's own value (`resolve("", n.Value)` for scalars),
so this rule is exactly the tag-aware identity
`docs/skills/yaml-key-identity/SKILL.md`
requires: a bare `1` and an explicitly `!!int`-tagged `1` are the same
key, but a bare `1` and an explicitly `!!str`-tagged (quoted) `"1"` are not,
and `01` and `1` are not (different `Value`). A `yaml.MappingNode` or
`yaml.SequenceNode` target instead yields `{complex: target}` — pointer
identity on the target node alone, with no structural expansion of the
complex key's contents: two distinct nodes that look alike are different
keys, two aliases sharing one complex target are the same key, and a
complex identity is never equal to any scalar identity (the zero
`*yaml.Node` complex field only appears alongside the zero scalar fields
for a nil or dead-ended-alias input, and a real complex node's pointer is
never nil). This is the tag-blind `sourceKeyID` above's direct
counterpart, not a reuse of it: `sourceKeyID` intentionally omits `Tag` to
reproduce yaml.v3's own duplicate-key guard exactly, while
`effectiveKeyIdentity` intentionally includes it because merge-precedence
resolution must not let a `!!str "1"` entry silently discard or be
discarded by an `!!int 1` entry from another merge source. A complex key's
identity is used only to decide _precedence_ — which candidate wins, and
whether two explicit complex keys collide (see below) — never to compute
it: a _winning_ complex key is still fully resolved and emitted
structurally, alias-free, by `emitEffectiveNode` like any other node
(charged against `maxEffectiveOutputNodes` like everything else it
emits), while a _losing_ complex key (impossible for two candidates to
tie on, since distinct complex-key nodes always have distinct pointers,
but reachable when the complex key belongs to a losing merge candidate's
value) is never dereferenced, resolved, or emitted at all.

**Validate-first, alias-resolving effective emitter
(`internal/config/effective.go`).** `resolveEffective(path string, doc
*yaml.Node) (*yaml.Node, *LoadError)` is the slice's entry point toward an
"effective" (post-merge) configuration tree, and imports only
`gopkg.in/yaml.v3` plus stdlib. It always calls `validateSourceGraph(path,
doc)` first and returns that error unchanged on failure — Detail and Path
byte-identical to what `validateSourceGraph` itself would return for the
same input — so a caller cannot use `resolveEffective` to bypass
source-graph validation, and `doc == nil` returns `(nil, nil)` only _after_
that successful validation, matching `parseYAMLDocument`'s valid
empty-input result.

On success `resolveEffective` emits a fresh copy of `doc` via the
unexported `emitEffectiveNode`: the result is rooted at a `yaml.DocumentNode`
copy with exactly one resolved child, and every emitted node — document,
mappings, sequences, keys, and values — copies exactly `Kind`, `Style`,
`Tag`, `Value`, `Line`, `Column`, `HeadComment`, `LineComment`, and
`FootComment` from the source node it corresponds to, via the unexported
`emitNodeMetadata`, leaving `Anchor` as `""` and `Alias` as `nil` on every
copy and allocating a distinct `*yaml.Node` each time (mutating the result
never mutates `doc`). A `yaml.AliasNode` is never copied as itself: the
unexported `dereferenceAliasTarget` follows its (possibly multi-hop) `Alias`
chain to the non-alias target first, and the emitted node carries that
_target's_ metadata, not the alias node's own — this applies identically
whether the alias appears in mapping value position or as a mapping key.
Because the output must stay alias-free, a single source node reached
through more than one alias becomes more than one independent fresh copy in
the result, and each such copy is charged separately against the
`maxEffectiveOutputNodes` budget described just below.

For a mapping node specifically, `emitEffectiveNode` does not copy the
target's raw `Content` — it emits `effectiveEntries(target)`'s winning
entries instead (`internal/config/effectivemerge.go`, described in the next
section), so only a winning key and its winning value are ever resolved and
charged against the budget; a losing merge candidate's value is never
cloned. A recognized `<<` merge key is therefore never itself emitted as a
key, and the result contains no recognized merge directive and no
`yaml.AliasNode` anywhere, at any depth — including inside a retained
mapping key's own subtree or a retained value's own nested merge.

`resolveEffective`'s emit path is bounded by the unexported `const
maxEffectiveOutputNodes = 100000`: every retained document, mapping,
sequence, key and value node counts exactly once toward it, mirroring
`sourcebounds.go`'s `pathVisitCount` accounting rule that "key", "value" and
"alias target" only name which child is traversed next and add no separate
charge, and each independent copy an expanded alias produces is charged
separately (an alias node itself is never charged, since it is dereferenced
to its target before the budget check runs). The check happens in
`emitEffectiveNode`'s first statements for each node — incrementing and
comparing a per-call counter _before_ allocating a `*yaml.Node` for that
node or recursing into its `Content` — so the 100,001st attempted emission
fails before its own allocation and before any of its descendants are ever
visited, which is what makes an exponential alias expansion (a compact,
small source graph whose alias-free output would otherwise need on the
order of `2^n` nodes) abort at the boundary rather than run to completion.
Once the budget is exceeded on any call, every other pending call in the
same `resolveEffective` invocation also returns immediately without further
allocation or recursion. Exactly `maxEffectiveOutputNodes` emitted nodes
succeeds; `maxEffectiveOutputNodes`+1 fails. On overflow `resolveEffective`
returns a nil tree and a `KindParseType` `*LoadError` with `Path` copied
from the `path` argument, a nil `Err`, and a `Detail` naming the
100,000-node bound and a source line for the node whose emission would have
crossed it. That line comes from reusing `sourcebounds.go`'s existing
`collectSourceInventory` and `attributeSourceLines` pair on the validated
source document — the same all-paths line attribution
(`checkSourceGraphBounds` uses it too) rather than a second, separate line-
attribution implementation — computed once when constructing the resolver
error: a node's own line when positive, otherwise its nearest positive-line
ancestor over all root-reachable paths, otherwise `1` for a wholly synthetic
graph with no line metadata anywhere, so the reported line is always positive.

**Merge precedence, memoized candidate inventory, merge-free output
(`internal/config/effectivemerge.go`).** `effectiveEntries(m *yaml.Node)
[]effectiveEntry` computes a mapping node's complete, ordered, deduplicated
inventory of winning entries — the real, yaml.v3-compatible merge-precedence
result `emitEffectiveNode`'s mapping branch emits from, replacing the
earlier chunk's interim "retain the `<<` key as an ordinary entry" behavior.
An `effectiveEntry` is an `{id effectiveKeyID, key, value *yaml.Node}`
triple: `id` is the candidate's `effectiveKeyIdentity` (`effectivekeys.go`),
used to decide whether two candidates from different sources are "the same
key"; `key` and `value` are the source nodes for that candidate, not yet
copied.

The inventory is built in two passes, then deduplicated once: first, every
retained explicit entry, in `m`'s source `Content` order, skipping any
recognized merge directive (`isMergeKey`); second, every inherited
candidate, discovered by merge directives in source `Content` order, each
directive's sequence operands left to right (`mergeOperandMappings`
unwraps a direct mapping, or an alias's _immediate_ target, matching
`validateMergeOperand`'s already-accepted shapes), and each operand
mapping's own `effectiveEntries` computed recursively — so a merge nested
inside a merge operand is fully flattened before its candidates are
considered here. The combined candidate list is then deduplicated by
`effectiveKeyIdentity`, keeping the _first_ candidate for each identity.
Because explicit entries are always listed first, this yields
explicit-over-merged precedence; because merge candidates are discovered in
directive-then-sequence-then-recursive order, it yields
earlier-sequence-operand-over-later precedence; and because the explicit
pass runs unconditionally before the merge pass regardless of where the
`<<` directive appears in `m`'s `Content`, an explicit key suppresses a
matching inherited candidate whether the directive comes before or after
that explicit key in the source. This matches `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` v3.0.1
`decode.go`'s `decoder.mapping`/`decoder.merge` behavior exactly:
`mapping` decodes explicit entries first and skips `isMerge` keys, then
`merge` seeds its `mergedFields` set from every explicit parent key before
consuming operands in `Content` order and marking each merged key as
consumed — with nested merges inheriting that accumulated set rather than
resetting it, which is why `effectiveEntries`' own recursive calls flatten
rather than re-seed.

The emitted mapping's key order is therefore fully deterministic: retained
explicit entries in source `Content` order, then inherited winners in
merge-candidate discovery order (directives in `Content` order, sequence
operands first to last, each operand's own effective entry order) —
running the same fixture through `resolveEffective` twice yields identical
order both times.

`effectiveEntries` delegates to the unexported `effectiveEntriesWithMemo`,
threading an `effectiveMergeMemo` (`map[*yaml.Node][]effectiveEntry`) keyed
by mapping-node pointer identity through the recursion described above. The
memo lives on `effectiveEmitState` for one complete `resolveEffective` call:
a mapping node reached as a merge operand through more than one emitted
parent, or through more than one alias to the same anchor, has its candidate
inventory computed once and reused rather than recomputed once per parent —
`TestResolveEffectiveSharedOperandInventoriedOnce`'s 40-level doubling merge
chain (mirroring `buildSourceSharingDAG`'s construction, but merging via
`<<: [*prev, *prev]` at each level instead of plain aliasing) would need on
the order of `2^40` recursive computations without this memo and completes
in well under a bounded timeout with it.
`TestResolveEffectiveSharedOperandMemoSpansEmittedMappings` separately pins
the memo lifetime: thousands of distinct retained parent mappings merge one
wide shared operand, which would rebuild that inventory for every parent if
the memo were scoped only to a top-level `effectiveEntries` call. A losing
candidate's value is never resolved by this pass either — `effectiveEntries`
only ever returns the source nodes for winning entries, so
`emitEffectiveNode` never clones, and never charges against
`maxEffectiveOutputNodes`, anything a merge discarded.

The post-alias key-identity-collision rule is layered on top of, not a
replacement for, `checkDuplicateMappingKeys`'s tag-blind `Kind`+`Value`
duplicate-key validation above, which `validateSourceGraph` still runs
first, unchanged: `effectiveEntriesWithMemo` additionally scans each
mapping's own retained explicit entries (the same entries its first pass
collects) for two whose `effectiveKeyIdentity` compare equal _after_ alias
dereferencing — catching, for example, a literal scalar key and an alias
key targeting an anchored scalar with the same resolved tag and value,
which `checkDuplicateMappingKeys` cannot catch because the alias node's
own `Kind` and `Value` differ from its target's. Finding such a pair sets
`effectiveEmitState.collided` and records the _later_ key (in source
`Content` order) as `collisionKey`, aborting the whole `resolveEffective`
call — exactly like a node-budget overflow aborts it — without
inventorying or emitting anything further; `resolveEffective` then returns
`effectiveIdentityCollisionError(path, doc, st.collisionKey)`, a
`KindParseType` `*LoadError` with a nil `Err` and a `Detail` reusing the
same `collectSourceInventory`/`attributeSourceLines` line-attribution pair
(own line, else nearest positive-line ancestor over all paths, else `1`)
as the output-limit error above. The rule applies only to two _explicit_
keys of one source mapping: an inherited merge candidate colliding with an
explicit key of the same identity is ordinary suppression (the existing
first-candidate dedup pass), not this error, since only an explicit
key can ever be the "other side" of a genuine ambiguity about which of two
literally-written keys in the same mapping was meant.

`emitEffectiveNode`, `dereferenceAliasTarget`/`emitNodeMetadata`, the
`effectiveEmitState` counter/collision-tracking type,
`effectiveOutputLimitError`, `effectiveIdentityCollisionError`,
`effectiveEntry`, `effectiveMergeMemo`, `effectiveEntriesWithMemo`,
`explicitKeyCollision`, and `mergeOperandMappings`/`mergeOperandMapping`
are all unexported helpers reachable only from `resolveEffective`; per the
frozen `directCallAllowlist` in `sourcesurface_test.go`, no `_test.go` file
names any of them directly — `effective_test.go`, `effectivebound_test.go`,
`effectivemerge_test.go`, and `effectiveidentity_test.go` exercise them
only through `resolveEffective` itself, alongside `resolveEffective` and
`effectiveKeyIdentity`, the two additions that allowlist authorizes.
Runtime loading reaches `resolveEffective` only through
`parseAndValidate`; its lower-level helpers remain encapsulated behind that
validator entry point.

**Reachable inventory, all-paths line attribution, and the 64
consecutive-alias-hop and 128-source-node-path-visit bounds
(`internal/config/sourcebounds.go`).** Once
`walkSourceNode`'s traversal and every check above have proven a source
graph acyclic and well-formed, `validateSourceGraph`'s single call to
`checkSourceGraphBounds` runs a second, purely additive pass — it never
runs on a graph that failed an earlier check, so a cyclic or otherwise
malformed graph still surfaces its original error (an alias cycle, a
malformed merge operand, a duplicate key) rather than a bounds error.
`collectSourceInventory` walks the already-proven-acyclic graph exactly
once per unique node, in `Content` slice order, recording every reachable
node in discovery order, every parent→child content edge reachable in the
graph — including a second edge into a node reached through more than one
parent, not just the edge the walk happened to follow first — and each
node's first-encounter active nearest positive-line ancestor.

`attributeSourceLines` gives every reachable node a source line to report
in a bounds-limit error: a node's own `Line` when positive; otherwise the
line of a positive-line ancestor at the minimum number of content edges
from it over _all_ root-reachable paths, not merely the path the traversal
happened to discover it by first; otherwise `1`, the deterministic
fallback for a wholly synthetic graph with no line metadata anywhere. This
is a multi-source breadth-first search in the parent→child direction,
seeded with every reachable positive-line node at distance zero attributing
its own line and relaxing each edge `parent→child` with
`(dist(parent)+1, line(parent))`; because it walks `collectSourceInventory`'s
already-deduplicated node and edge lists, it visits each at most once and
is `O(V+E)`, so it never re-expands a shared subgraph once per path — the
same discipline that keeps a compact alias-sharing DAG linear rather than
exponential. When two positive-line ancestors tie at the same minimum
distance to a node, the node's first-encounter active ancestor wins if it
is one of the tied candidates; otherwise the candidate reached through the
parent with the lower discovery index wins. An alias edge participates in
this distance exactly like an ordinary content edge, so a node reachable
one alias hop below a positive-line ancestor can out-distance — and so
out-rank — a farther positive-line ancestor reached only through ordinary
content.

The alias-hop bound itself is a memoized dynamic program over node
identity: `hops(n) = 1 + hops(n.Alias)` for a `yaml.AliasNode`, and `0` for
every other kind, so descending from any non-alias node into ordinary
content always resets the count for that child path — which is why more
than 64 independent, shallow sibling aliases to the same anchored target
all succeed even though there are far more than 64 of them in the graph.
`aliasHopCount` memoizes by node pointer, so a node reachable through many
parents is computed once rather than once per path. `checkAliasHopLimit`
rejects the first node (in discovery order) whose `aliasHopCount` exceeds
64 as `KindParseType`, naming the 64-hop limit and reporting
`attributeSourceLines`' line for that node; exactly 64 consecutive hops
succeeds and 65 fails.

The 128-source-node-path-visit bound is a second, separate memoized
dynamic program over node identity: `pathVisitCount(n) = 1 +
max(pathVisitCount(child))` over every content edge reachable directly
from `n` — a document's, mapping's, or sequence's `Content` entries, or an
alias node's single `Alias` target — and `1` for a node with no such
children (an ordinary scalar). Every encountered node, including a
mapping's own key nodes, contributes exactly one visit; "key", "value",
and "alias target" only name which child is traversed next and add no
separate charge, so a scalar used as a mapping key counts once, not once
for being a scalar plus once for being a key, and an alias node plus its
target contribute two visits together, not one. `pathVisitCount` memoizes
by node pointer exactly like `aliasHopCount`, so wide siblings that all
share one deep target are each checked once and do not accumulate a
global count, and a compact alias-sharing DAG is evaluated in time linear
in its node and edge count rather than once per exponentially-many
root-to-leaf paths.

Because `pathVisitCount` is monotonically non-decreasing from any node
toward the root, once one node's count exceeds 128 every one of its
ancestors up to the graph's root does too; `checkSourcePathVisitLimit`
therefore does not report the first over-limit node found in discovery
order (which would almost always be the root itself, carrying no useful
attribution) but instead walks `inv.nodes` in discovery order for the
_boundary_ node — one whose own count exceeds 128 but whose every direct
child does not, i.e. the exact point along an offending path where the
count first crosses the limit — and reports `attributeSourceLines`' line
for that node, naming the 128-visit limit; this stays deterministic even
when more than one branch independently crosses the boundary, since
discovery order breaks the tie. Exactly 128 source-node visits on a
root-to-leaf path succeeds and 129 fails. When a graph violates both
bounds, `checkSourceGraphBounds` checks the alias-hop bound first, so the
alias-hop error is reported and the path-visit pass never runs. Every
error either pass returns has a nil `Err`, like every other
`validateSourceGraph` rejection.

**Canonical page/group inventory (`internal/config/schema.go`).** `SchemaPages()`
and `SchemaGroups(page)` derive the authoritative list of page names and,
per page, group names by reflection — never by a second hand-maintained
list — so the inventory cannot drift from the types it describes. Page names
come from the `yaml` struct tags on `Config`'s exported fields (via the
unexported `yamlFieldNames` helper, in struct declaration order); group names
for a page come from that page's map key set in `defaultConfig()` (via the
unexported `schemaPageGroups` helper, sorted lexicographically for a stable
API since map iteration order is not deterministic). `rawConfig` is _not_ a
schema authority here — it is `Config`'s pointer-typed YAML-decoding mirror
(see above), and a dedicated reflection test
(`TestRawConfigMatchesConfigFields`) proves its exported fields, field order,
and yaml tag names match `Config`'s exactly, so it stays a provably-in-sync
mirror rather than a second source of truth per
`docs/skills/canonical-schema/SKILL.md`.
Both exported functions return a freshly allocated slice (and `SchemaGroups`
an error for a page name outside `SchemaPages()`) on every call, so a caller
mutating a returned slice cannot affect a later call. An empty or duplicate
page/group name is reported as a returned `error`, never a panic, `log.Fatal`,
or `os.Exit`, so failures stay deterministic and assertable from tests.

`SchemaGroupFields()` and `SchemaActionFields()` extend the same inventory to
field names, reusing `yamlFieldNames` — no second tag-parsing rule.
`SchemaGroupFields()` reads `rawGroupConfig`'s yaml tags, in struct
declaration order, because `rawGroupConfig` (not `GroupConfig`) is what
yaml.v3 actually decodes a group into; `GroupConfig` remains the semantic
authority, and a dedicated reflection test
(`TestRawGroupConfigMatchesGroupConfigFields`) holds the two to each other —
same field count, same names and yaml tags per index, and each
`rawGroupConfig` field type equal to `GroupConfig`'s or exactly a pointer to
it (ignoring only that pointer-vs-value difference and `omitempty`) — so
`rawGroupConfig` cannot silently drift from `GroupConfig` per
`docs/skills/canonical-schema/SKILL.md`.
`SchemaActionFields()` reads `ActionConfig`'s yaml tags directly, since
`ActionConfig` has no raw/pointer mirror. Both return a freshly allocated
slice on every call and report an empty or duplicate field name as an error,
never a panic, `log.Fatal`, or `os.Exit`. `parseAndValidate` consumes this
inventory in production, so unknown pages, groups, and fields are rejected by
the runtime loader rather than silently ignored.

**The four-stage validator entry point (`internal/config/validate.go`).**
`parseAndValidate(path string, data []byte) (*rawConfig, *LoadError)` is the
unexported entry point that ties together every validation capability
described above into a single call: stage 1 is `parseYAMLDocument`
(source.go); stage 2 is `resolveEffective` (effective.go), which itself runs
`validateSourceGraph` (sourcegraph.go, including its `checkSourceGraphBounds`
bounds pass, sourcebounds.go) before emitting an alias-free, merge-resolved
effective document; stage 3 is this file's own document-level shape check;
and stage 4 decodes an accepted mapping document into a `*rawConfig`. A
stage 1 or stage 2 `*LoadError` is returned unchanged — `parseAndValidate`
can never bypass parser, source-graph, or bounds validation by continuing
past their errors.

The full pipeline, in order, is: `parseAndValidate` calls `parseYAMLDocument`
(stage 1) to parse `data` into a single `*yaml.Node` document, rejecting a
malformed document or a second document; then `resolveEffective` (stage 2),
which validates the reachable source-branch graph via `validateSourceGraph`
(including its node/path/alias-hop bounds) before resolving `<<` merges and
aliases into one alias-free effective tree; then this file's own ChairLift
schema/shape/declared-type validation (stage 3) walks that effective tree
page by page, group by group, group-field by group-field, and (for
`actions`) action-entry by action-field; and finally, only once every prior
stage and every entry at every level has passed, stage 4 decodes the
already-validated effective document into a `*rawConfig` via
`yaml.Node.Decode`. A failure at any earlier stage returns immediately
without running any later stage.

Every reachable outcome of that pipeline classifies to exactly one of three
results — `KindParseType`, `KindSchema`, or a valid decoded/no-op result —
per this decision table:

| Effective input                                                                   | Result                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| malformed YAML, second document, or source duplicate                              | `KindParseType`            |
| cyclic, malformed, source-path-over-budget, or effective-output-over-budget graph | `KindParseType`            |
| empty document or top-level null                                                  | valid no-op overlay        |
| top-level scalar or sequence                                                      | `KindParseType`            |
| unknown top-level page                                                            | `KindSchema`               |
| known page with null                                                              | valid no-op for that page  |
| known page with scalar or sequence                                                | `KindParseType`            |
| unknown group under a known page                                                  | `KindSchema`               |
| known group with null                                                             | valid no-op for that group |
| known group with scalar or sequence                                               | `KindParseType`            |
| unknown group field                                                               | `KindSchema`               |
| `actions` value that is not null or a sequence                                    | `KindParseType`            |
| action entry that is null or otherwise not a mapping                              | `KindParseType`            |
| unknown action field                                                              | `KindSchema`               |
| known field that cannot decode into its declared Go type                          | `KindParseType`            |
| valid effective document                                                          | decoded `*rawConfig`       |

The first four rows are produced by stages 1-2 (`parseYAMLDocument`,
`validateSourceGraph`, `resolveEffective`) and always take precedence: a
parser, graph, source-duplicate, or resolver-bound failure is returned
before stage 3 ever inspects a single mapping entry. Every remaining row is
produced by stage 3's per-level entry walk or stage 4's final `Decode`.

At every one of the four name levels (page, group, group field, action
field), each mapping entry is classified in this fixed order, and later
steps never run once an earlier one has already classified the entry:

1. **Key shape.** A mapping key counts as a name only when its effective
   node is a scalar whose `ShortTag()` is exactly `!!str`. An integer,
   boolean, or null scalar key; a custom-tagged scalar; a sequence or
   mapping key; or an alias to any of those, is rejected as `KindParseType`
   via `validatorKeyShapeError` before its name or value is inspected at
   all. `schemaKeyName` implements this rule; the quoted string key `"<<"`
   resolves to tag `!!str` and is therefore an ordinary name (rejected as
   `KindSchema` if absent from the canonical inventory, like any other
   unrecognized name) — it is only the bare, unquoted `<<` merge key that
   carries yaml.v3's own `!!merge` tag, and that key is consumed by
   `resolveEffective` during stage 2, long before `schemaKeyName` ever runs,
   so it never reaches this classification at all.
2. **Name membership**, checked without descending into that entry's value.
   A well-formed string key that is not present in the canonical inventory
   for that level is rejected as `KindSchema`, naming the literal offending
   key and a positive line — regardless of whether the associated value is
   null, a scalar, a sequence, or a mapping. An unknown name's value is
   never inspected, decoded, or recursed into.
3. **Value inspection**, only for a name that passed step 2. A known page's
   or group's non-null scalar/sequence value is `KindParseType`; a null
   value is a no-op; a mapping value recurses one schema level down. A known
   group field's or action field's value is decoded into a fresh instance of
   that field's declared Go type, with any `*yaml.TypeError` (or other
   decode failure) preserved in `Err` and classified `KindParseType`.

Page, group, group-field, and action-field name inventories are never a
hand-maintained list in `validate.go`. `SchemaPages()`, `SchemaGroupFields()`,
and `SchemaActionFields()` (schema.go) reflect directly on the canonical
`Config`, `rawGroupConfig`, and `ActionConfig` structs, so adding, renaming,
or removing a field on one of those structs changes the accepted schema
automatically, with no parallel edit required in the validator. `SchemaGroups(page)`
is derived differently: it reads the group names present as map keys in that
page's entry in `defaultConfig()`, not struct fields of `Config` — a group
added only to `defaultConfig()`'s map (with no corresponding struct field)
still changes the accepted schema, and a parity test keeps that map's keys
from drifting out of sync with the fields the validator otherwise expects.

**Interpretation I8: runtime validation precedes `mergePage`'s tolerant
mechanics.** `mergePage` (config.go) mechanically
tolerates a group name absent from `defaultConfig()` for a page: it
synthesizes a zero `GroupConfig{Enabled: true}` as the merge base and
proceeds, matching `IsGroupEnabled`'s "missing group -> enabled" fallback.
`parseAndValidate`'s `validateGroupEntries`, by contrast, rejects that same
unknown group name outright as `KindSchema`. Runtime loading always calls
`parseAndValidate` before `mergeConfig`, so unrecognized groups can never
reach `mergePage`; its tolerance remains useful only to package-internal
callers operating on already trusted `rawConfig` values.

Once both prior stages succeed, stage 3 classifies the effective document by
its top-level node shape into exactly one of these outcomes:

- **Nil effective document** (the shared "empty or whitespace-only input"
  result `parseYAMLDocument`/`resolveEffective` already return for that
  case) — a non-nil, zero-valued `*rawConfig` (every page map nil/empty) and
  no error. This is a usable no-op overlay, matching the "absent config"
  semantics elsewhere in this package. Stage 4's `Decode` call never runs
  for this outcome.
- **Top-level null scalar** (YAML's `null`/`~`, or an absent value, which
  yaml.v3 resolves to tag `!!null`) — treated identically to the nil-document
  outcome above: a non-nil, zero-valued `*rawConfig`, no error, and no
  `Decode` call.
- **Top-level scalar that is not null, or a top-level sequence** — rejected
  as `KindParseType` via the unexported `validatorShapeError`, which names
  the actual shape found and a positive source line from the unexported
  `effectiveNodeLine` (`n.Line`, clamped to `1` when yaml.v3 left it
  non-positive, mirroring `effectiveOutputLimitError`'s own clamp). No
  `Decode` call runs for this outcome either, since there is no mapping to
  decode.
- **Top-level mapping** — accepted structurally, and its entries are
  classified one at a time, in effective `Content` order, by
  `validatePageEntries` (interpretation I3's per-entry order: key shape,
  then name membership, then value shape):
  - A mapping key whose effective node is not a scalar with `ShortTag() ==
"!!str"` — an integer, boolean, or null scalar; a custom-tagged scalar;
    a sequence; a mapping; or an alias to any of those (already
    dereferenced into a copy of its target by `resolveEffective`) — is
    rejected as `KindParseType` via the unexported `validatorKeyShapeError`
    before its name or value is ever inspected. The unexported
    `schemaKeyName(key *yaml.Node) (string, bool)` implements this rule; a
    quoted `"<<"` key resolves to tag `!!str` (an ordinary name), while a
    bare `<<` merge key carries `!!merge` and is consumed by
    `resolveEffective` long before this walk runs, so it never reaches
    `schemaKeyName` at all.
  - A well-formed string key that is not one of `SchemaPages()`'s canonical
    page names (schema.go, reflected off `Config`'s yaml tags — never a
    literal list in validate.go) is rejected as `KindSchema` via the
    unexported `validatorSchemaError`, naming the literal offending key and
    a positive line, without descending into that entry's value at all.
    (`SchemaPages()` returning an error — only possible for a malformed
    struct tag on `Config` itself, which cannot happen for that canonical
    struct — is still surfaced defensively as a `KindSchema` `*LoadError`
    via the unexported `validatorSchemaPagesError`, wrapping the reflect
    error, rather than ignored or panicked on.)
  - A known page's **null** value is accepted as a no-op for that page.
  - A known page's **non-null scalar or sequence** value is rejected as
    `KindParseType` via the unexported `validatorPageValueShapeError`,
    naming the page, the actual shape found, and a positive line.
  - A known page's **mapping** value has its own entries — groups — classified
    the same way, one schema level down, by `validateGroupEntries`:
    - A non-`!!str` mapping key is rejected as `KindParseType` via
      `validatorKeyShapeError`, exactly as at page level.
    - A well-formed string key that is not one of `SchemaGroups(page)`'s
      canonical group names for that page (schema.go, reflected off
      `defaultConfig()` — never a literal list in validate.go) is rejected as
      `KindSchema` via `validatorSchemaError`, naming the offending key and a
      positive line, without descending into its value. (`SchemaGroups`
      erroring — only possible for a page unknown to it, which cannot happen
      once `page` has passed `SchemaPages()` — is still surfaced defensively
      as `KindSchema` via the unexported `validatorSchemaGroupsError`.)
    - A known group's **null** value is a no-op for that group; its
      **non-null scalar or sequence** value is `KindParseType` via the
      unexported `validatorGroupValueShapeError`, naming the group, shape,
      and line.
    - A known group's **mapping** value has its own entries — group fields —
      classified by `validateGroupFieldEntries`, sourced from the unexported
      `groupFieldTypes()` (reflection over `rawGroupConfig`'s yaml tags and
      declared Go field types — never a literal list in validate.go, aside
      from the literal name `"actions"` itself, needed for the special case
      below):
      - A non-`!!str` mapping key is rejected as `KindParseType`, exactly as
        at page and group level; an unrecognized field name is rejected as
        `KindSchema`, exactly as an unrecognized group name is.
      - The special-cased `actions` field is recognized as a known name and
        validated structurally by the unexported `validateActionsEntries`,
        instead of by a generic decode into `*[]ActionConfig` (interpretation
        I5, because yaml.v3 silently ignores an unknown struct field on
        decode and silently decodes a null sequence entry into a zero
        `ActionConfig`):
        - Its value must be **null** (a no-op — no actions configured) or a
          **sequence**; any other shape (a non-null scalar or a mapping) is
          rejected as `KindParseType` via the unexported
          `validatorActionsValueShapeError`, naming the actual shape found
          and a positive line.
        - Every sequence entry must be a YAML **mapping**; a **null** entry
          is explicitly not accepted as a zero action, and a scalar or
          sequence entry is likewise rejected — all as `KindParseType` via
          the unexported `validatorActionEntryShapeError`.
        - Each mapping entry's own fields are classified by the unexported
          `validateActionFieldEntries`, one schema level down from a group's
          fields and sourced from the unexported `actionFieldTypes()`
          (reflection over `ActionConfig`'s yaml tags and declared Go field
          types — never a literal list in validate.go): a non-`!!str`
          mapping key is `KindParseType`, exactly as at page/group/group-field
          level; an unrecognized action-field name (e.g. `SchemaActionFields()`
          not listing it) is `KindSchema` via `validatorSchemaError`, naming
          the offending key and a positive line, without descending into its
          value; and a known field's effective value node is decoded into a
          fresh value of its declared Go type
          (`reflect.New(fieldType).Interface()`), a decode failure
          (yaml.v3's own `*yaml.TypeError`, e.g. `sudo: {a: 1}` into `bool`)
          classified `KindParseType` via `validatorDecodeError`, with the
          yaml.v3 error's message in `Detail` and the error itself preserved
          in `Err`.
      - Every other known field's effective value node is decoded into a
        fresh value of that field's declared Go type,
        `reflect.New(fieldType).Interface()` (interpretation I4) — e.g.
        `enabled`'s `*bool`, `bundles_paths`'s `*[]string`. A decode failure
        (yaml.v3's own `*yaml.TypeError`, e.g. `enabled: [1, 2]` into
        `*bool`) is classified `KindParseType` via the unexported
        `validatorDecodeError`, with the yaml.v3 error's message in `Detail`
        and the error itself preserved in `Err` — the same builder stage 4's
        final `Decode` call uses.

  Once every entry passes, stage 4 calls the effective document's
  `yaml.Node.Decode` into a `*rawConfig`. A `Decode` failure here is
  classified `KindParseType` via the unexported `validatorDecodeError`,
  with the yaml.v3 error's message in `Detail` and the error itself
  preserved in `Err` — a defensive final step, since
  `validateSourceGraph`/`resolveEffective` and the page-entry walk above
  already prove the effective document is well-formed by the time `Decode`
  runs, but any residual decode failure is still classified rather than
  left unhandled. Once every level's fields pass, an explicitly set zero
  value survives the decode as set, not as omission: `enabled: false`,
  `app_id: ""`, and `bundles_paths: []` all decode to non-nil pointers
  (`*bool`, `*string`, `*[]string`) carrying `false`, `""`, and an empty
  non-nil slice respectively — `rawGroupConfig`'s pointer fields exist
  precisely so a merge onto `defaultConfig()` can tell "explicitly set to
  the zero value" apart from "key absent."

Per the guarded `directCallAllowlist` in `sourcesurface_test.go`,
`parseAndValidate` and `resolveCandidatePath` are the runtime entry helpers
authorized for direct test calls;
`validatorShapeError`, `validatorDecodeError`, `effectiveNodeLine`,
`validatePageEntries`, `schemaKeyName`, `validatorSchemaError`,
`validatorSchemaPagesError`, `validatorKeyShapeError`,
`validatorPageValueShapeError`, `describeNodeShape`,
`validateGroupEntries`, `validatorSchemaGroupsError`,
`validatorGroupValueShapeError`, `validateGroupFieldEntries`,
`groupFieldTypes`, `validatorGroupFieldTypesError`,
`validateActionsEntries`, `validatorActionsValueShapeError`,
`validatorActionEntryShapeError`, `validateActionFieldEntries`,
`actionFieldTypes`, and `validatorActionFieldTypesError` are all exercised
only indirectly, through `parseAndValidate`, in `validate_test.go`.

**Runtime loading, precedence, and diagnostics
(`internal/config/config.go`, `paths.go`, `diagnostic.go`).** `Load` resolves
each configured candidate to the exact path it will read, then calls
`loadResolvedPath`, which reads bytes, runs `parseAndValidate`, and only then
merges the validated overlay onto `defaultConfig()`. A missing candidate
(`errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist)`) advances to the next search location. Any
other read failure, or any parse/type/schema failure in the first file that
exists, makes that file authoritative: lower-priority files are not read,
`Load` returns `disabledConfig()` plus the structured `*LoadError`, and every
canonical feature group is hidden while non-visibility defaults remain
available. If all candidates are absent, the ordinary built-in defaults and
a nil error are returned.

`resolveCandidatePath` makes diagnostic paths deterministic and absolute when
the operating system supplies a working directory: absolute candidates are
cleaned; a relative candidate prefers a file beside the executable and
otherwise resolves against the current working directory. Filesystem reads,
the executable path, and the working directory have narrow package-level
seams so precedence and permission failures are testable without relying on
host permissions.

On an authoritative failure, `LoadError.LogMessage` prefixes the full
path-and-cause diagnostic with `CONFIGURATION ERROR`, states that all groups
were disabled, and instructs the user to restart after fixing the file.
`window.New` retains the same `LoadError`, builds the toast overlay, then calls
`ShowErrorToast` with `LoadError.ToastMessage`. `ShowErrorToast` sets timeout
zero, so the startup error remains visible instead of expiring; construction
and the toast call both occur on the GTK main thread.

### Package manager wrapper pattern

Each wrapper in `internal/` follows a consistent shape:

- Reads `dryrun.Enabled()` from the single process-wide `internal/dryrun` package (see "Dry-run mode" above) rather than keeping a package-level flag
- `IsInstalled()` to check tool availability, plus `IsInstalledCached()` (`sync.Once`) for use from views during async startup
- Homebrew, Flatpak, and Updex implement both `IsInstalled()` and `IsInstalledCached()`
- List/Search/Install/Uninstall/Update functions
- Context-based timeouts. Homebrew and Flatpak both use a two-class model selected per invocation by an unexported `commandTimeout(args)` helper: 30s for read-only commands, 30m for state-changing ones (the keys of each package's `stateChangingCommands` map). updex uses 5min and bootc 30min.
- Custom error types where needed

### Shared OS staging progress (`internal/stageexec`)

`bootc.StageUpdate` and `sysupdate.StageUpdate` retain their provider APIs and
fixed commands — `pkexec /usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` and `pkexec
/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage`, respectively — but both delegate execution
to the pure-Go `internal/stageexec` leaf package:

1. The caller creates the provider's `ProgressEvent` channel; both provider
   types are aliases of `stageexec.ProgressEvent`.
2. Each non-empty output line becomes an `EventMessage`; the channel is closed after either an `EventComplete` (success) or the function returning an error
3. Event types: `EventMessage` and `EventComplete` — deliberately simpler than
   a step/percent model because the stage script's own output is unstructured
   log lines, not a structured progress protocol. Failures return as errors;
   they are not duplicated into the event stream.
4. `stageexec.Run` owns merged stdout/stderr, non-zero exits with the last output
   line, deadline/cancellation classification, missing bare-name or absolute-path
   executables, direct-child kill/reap, the single success completion, and
   channel closure. `stageexec.DryRun` owns the synthetic preview/completion and
   closure without constructing an `exec.Cmd`.
5. The bootc and sysupdate view goroutines read the same event contract and
   dispatch UI updates to the main thread via `sgtk.RunOnMainThread`.

**Caller-visible outcomes.** Provider adapters preserve `bootc.Error` /
`sysupdate.Error` and `NotFoundError` while carrying the shared executor's
message and cause. Both context-taking bootc functions classify failures with
`errors.Is` against the context sentinels, and `bootc.Error` has an `Err error`
field plus `Unwrap() error` so callers can tell them apart:

- Either provider's `StageUpdate` — deadline: provider `*Error` "Update staging timed out" unwrapping to `context.DeadlineExceeded`; cancellation: provider `*Error` "Update staging was canceled" unwrapping to `context.Canceled`; non-zero exit: provider `*Error` "update staging failed (exit N): <last output line>" matching neither sentinel; missing `pkexec`: provider `*NotFoundError`.
- `GetStatus` — deadline: `*Error` "bootc status timed out" unwrapping to `context.DeadlineExceeded`; cancellation: `*Error` "bootc status was canceled" unwrapping to `context.Canceled`; non-zero exit: `*Error` "bootc status failed (exit N): <stderr>" matching neither sentinel; missing `bootc`: `*NotFoundError`. `GetStatus(ctx)` is `return getStatusFrom(ctx, bootcCommand)`; the unexported `getStatusFrom` seam exists so tests exercise all of these against a fake script without a real `bootc`.

The deadline and cancellation messages differ in both functions, and neither ever surfaces as `signal: killed`.

**OS staging direct-kills; homebrew and flatpak kill the process group.** On
cancellation `stageexec.Run` kills only the direct child (`cmd.Process.Kill()`)
and sets no `Setpgid`, because both staging adapters run under `pkexec` and the
privileged child cannot be signaled as an unprivileged process group. The
unprivileged Homebrew and Flatpak runners instead kill their whole process
groups so download helpers are not orphaned. Making either privileged staging
path group-killable is a privilege-model change.

**`helperexec` bounds the wait; it does not stop the work.**
`internal/helperexec.Run` has the same privilege constraint and sets a finite
`WaitDelay` (5s, matching `internal/maintenanceexec`) so cancellation returns
even when a privileged descendant of the helper inherited stdout/stderr and
still holds those pipes open. Only the direct `pkexec` child is killed, so
that descendant may keep mutating the system after `Run` returns; the
cancellation message therefore reads "command canceled (privileged work
already started may still be running)" rather than implying the action
stopped, and surfaces rendering it must not imply otherwise. Coordinating
deadlines with root descendants (issue #82's broader ask) would require a
privilege-model change.

Because `WaitDelay` applies to every run, `cmd.Run` can report
`exec.ErrWaitDelay` for a helper that already finished. `Run` classifies from
the helper's own exit status in that case — success stays success (with
possibly truncated captured output) instead of inviting a retry of work that
already happened, and a non-zero exit keeps its "command failed (exit N)"
message. For the same reason a cancel or deadline racing a genuine helper
failure does not mask it: the context classification applies only when the
helper was killed rather than exiting on its own. `helperexec.Error` carries
an `Err error` with `Unwrap`, so "command timed out" and the cancellation
message match `context.DeadlineExceeded` / `context.Canceled` under
`errors.Is`, the convention `stageexec` already follows.

**Why a stage script instead of `bootc upgrade`:** upstream `bootc upgrade`'s registry-transport pull currently fails on snow's composefs images. The snow-shipped `/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` script works around this: `podman pull` fetches the image into containers-storage (podman's pull path works where bootc's does not), then `bootc switch --transport containers-storage` stages the already-pulled image as the next boot deployment. This keeps snow's actual upgrade logic in one place (the snosi script) rather than duplicating pull/switch orchestration in ChairLift; ChairLift only invokes the script via pkexec and streams its output. The script is idempotent — it exits 0 without staging anything when the deployment is already current.

### bootc progress UI (updates page)

`onBootcStageClicked()` (`internal/views/updates_page.go`) drives the "System Update" expander: it disables the button, spawns `bootc.StageUpdate` in a goroutine, and processes the `ProgressEvent` channel on a second goroutine through `stageProgressSink` — `EventMessage` lines are batched by `internal/views/progresslog` and rendered into a log expander with their arrival timestamps, capped at the most recent `progresslog.DefaultLimit` rows, and `EventComplete` flushes the last batch and marks the activity complete. A returned `stageErr` drives the error subtitle and toast after the stream closes; there is no duplicate error event. After `wg.Wait()` returns, the handler re-reads live `bootc.GetStatus()` and calls `uh.updateCounts.Set(badgestate.Bootc, 0|1)` plus `uh.updateBadgeCount()` unconditionally in both dry-run and live mode (this is a plain read, not a mutation, so it always reflects reality); it then sets `expander`'s subtitle from that same live read unconditionally as well, but shows `actionmsg.BootcStage(dryrun.Enabled(), staged)` for the completion toast — an explicit preview string under dry-run rather than one of the "staged"/"up to date" strings that read as a verified completion claim about a click that, under dry-run, checked and changed nothing. The system page has a separate, simpler bootc path: `loadBootcStatus` (gated on `IsBootcBootedCached()`) calls `bootc.GetStatus` to show the booted/staged/rollback deployment images, versions, and digests, with no staging controls of its own — staging happens on the Updates page.

### Update badge tracking

The updates page stores bootc, sysupdate, Flatpak, and Homebrew counts in the
mutex-backed `badgestate.Counts` value on `UserHome`. The bootc provider is 1
when `bootc.GetStatus()` reports a staged deployment and 0 otherwise — a
boolean folded into the total, not a count of available images. The sysupdate
provider follows the same boolean rule: 1 when `sysupdate.GetStatus().IsStaged()`
(the `/run/snosi/update-staged` semaphore exists, or the last check recorded
`outcome=staged`) and 0 otherwise, including after a failed check — there is
no persistent "available but unstaged" state because the snosi stager checks
and stages in one run. Provider refreshes use
`Set`, so a repeated load replaces rather than accumulates; successful
row-level Homebrew upgrades use `Add(Homebrew, -1)`, which cannot go below
zero. `updateBadgeCount` reads the aggregate `Total` and pushes it through
`ToastAdder.SetUpdateBadge()`. Refresh requests receive an increasing
generation from `actionstate.RefreshGate`; only the newest request may apply
its result, so an older, slower query cannot overwrite newer metadata. Every
completion callback still runs when superseded so its action is restored. Only
a successful current query replaces rows/count. A command or refresh failure
preserves the last known count (and a refresh failure preserves the current
rows), while dry-run previews restore their controls without changing either.

[ADR-0006](../adr/0006-split-system-integration-package-with-mutual-conflicts.md)
(the system-integration package split).

bootc staging, native A/B staging, updex, and Bluefin-family system operations
require root for state-changing operations. They invoke commands through
`pkexec` (PolicyKit). bootc runs `pkexec /usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage`
directly (polkit action id `io.projectbluefin.chairlift.bootc.stage`), native
A/B staging runs `pkexec /usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` directly
(`internal/sysupdate.StageScriptPath`, action id
`io.projectbluefin.chairlift.sysupdate.stage`), updex delegates to the fixed
absolute path `internal/updex.HelperPath` (`/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper`),
and Bluefin-family writes delegate to `internal/ublue.HelperPath`
(`/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`). Policy files are installed for all four
fixed surfaces: `data/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.bootc.policy`,
`data/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.sysupdate.policy`,
`data/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.updex.policy`, and
`data/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.ublue.policy`.

**Why the helper paths must be absolute, and why `PREFIX=/usr`:** `pkexec`
resolves the program it's asked to run to an absolute path and compares it
textually against the `org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path` annotation on each
action. The updex policy's three actions annotate
`/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper`; the ublue policy's nine actions annotate
`/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`. Both helper policies use
`org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.argv1` to select exactly one action for the
first helper argument. PolicyKit does not validate the remainder of argv, so
the privileged helpers are a second boundary: `internal/updexhelper.ParseInvocation`
accepts only `enable-feature <name> [--dry-run]`, `disable-feature <name>
[--dry-run]`, and `update [--dry-run]`, while
`internal/ubluehelper.ParseInvocation` accepts only `channel-switch
<stable|testing> [--dry-run]`, `dx-enable [--dry-run]`, `dx-disable
[--dry-run]`, `restart [--dry-run]`, `rollback [--dry-run]`,
`auto-updates-enable [--dry-run]`, `auto-updates-disable [--dry-run]`,
`driver-switch <standard|nvidia|nvidia-open> [--dry-run]`, and `factory-reset
[--dry-run]`. A bare, `$PATH`-resolved command
name can resolve to a different
absolute path depending on the invoking process's `$PATH`, which makes the
path comparison miss and falls `pkexec` back to the generic, more restrictive
action. The wrapper packages therefore always invoke their fixed `HelperPath`
constants, never a bare name.

Two inputs deliberately never cross the pkexec boundary as arguments:

- **The target image reference.** Only a channel word is passed. The helper
  resolves the concrete reference itself, from the read-only image descriptor
  at `internal/imageinfo.DescriptorPath` and the channel table below. An
  authenticated caller therefore cannot direct `bootc switch` at an arbitrary
  registry.
- **The username.** The helper resolves it from the `PKEXEC_UID` that pkexec
  sets on the invoking session (`internal/ubluehelper.TargetUID`, which
  rejects an absent, non-numeric, or root value), so an authenticated caller
  cannot add an unrelated account to the privileged developer groups.

Gaming mode, the third Bluefin-family feature, crosses no privilege boundary
at all: every component is a user-scope Flatpak installed with
`flatpak install --user`, the same reasoning that keeps Homebrew tap trust
unprivileged.

Its components are not all applications, and `internal/gaming` models the
difference rather than assuming it away. Each entry in the stack carries a
`flatpak.Kind` — five are `KindApplication`, and MangoHud
(`org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.MangoHud`) is `KindRuntime`, because
it ships as a Vulkan-layer extension of `org.freedesktop.Platform` rather
than as an app. `flatpak list --app` and `flatpak list --runtime` are
mutually exclusive filters, so the inventory runs one query per
(scope, kind) pair — four in total — and keys its result on a
`gaming.Ref{Kind, ID}` rather than on the ID alone. An application-only
inventory reported MangoHud missing however it had been installed, which
made Enable reinstall it on every run and left Disable unable to remove the
user-scope ref ChairLift had put there (issue #75). Failure handling follows
the same shape one level up: a scope that cannot be listed is tolerated, but
a *kind* that answered in neither scope is fatal, because reporting its
components missing is exactly the loop that bug was.

### Unified updates

The Updates page's single "update this machine" surface is three layers, two
of which are pure and testable on a headless host:

- **`internal/updateflow`** is the coordinator. It owns the four update
  sources (`applications`, `developer-tools`, `system-components`,
  `operating-system`), their per-source state, the aggregate `Phase`, and the
  single primary `Action` a snapshot offers. It executes nothing itself:
  every source is an `updateflow.Provider` (`ID`, `Available`, `Check`,
  `Apply`), and post-update cleanup is an `updateflow.Maintenance` seam.
  `Check` runs the configured, available, user-enabled sources concurrently;
  `UpdateAll` applies them *serially*, in the coordinator's fixed provider
  order, publishing an immutable `Snapshot` at every transition.
- **`internal/views/updatepresent`** is the presentation layer, and is
  equally pure: `Snapshot` maps one coordinator snapshot to a
  `Presentation{Icon, Title, Description, ActionLabel, ShowAction,
  ActionStyle, Banner}`, and `Source` (title plus subtitle), `SourceIcon`, and
  `ItemSubtitle` render one source row. Every user-visible string in the
  update surface lives here, so the copy is unit-tested without a display.
- **`internal/views/update_shell.go`** (`UpdateShell`) is widget wiring only.
  It holds no update state of its own: it starts generation-guarded work off
  the GTK thread, marshals each published snapshot back through
  `sgtk.RunOnMainThread`, and applies whatever `updatepresent` decided.

Keeping those three separate is the point. A phase decision belongs in
`updateflow`, a string belongs in `updatepresent`, and `update_shell.go`
decides neither.

`derive` is where the aggregate state is computed, and its precedence is
deliberate: checking and updating outrank everything; an apply failure
(`PhasePartialFailure`, `ActionRetryFailed`) outranks a check failure
(`PhaseCheckFailed`, `ActionCheck`); a maintenance failure is reported as a
partial failure rather than swallowed; and only once nothing has failed does
a pending restart (`PhaseRestartRequired`, `ActionRestart`) or ordinary
readiness (`ActionUpdateAll` when something is pending, `ActionCheck` when
nothing is) apply. A source that fails does not stop the others: applications,
developer tools, system components, and the OS image are independent.

`ActionRestart` exists because `PhaseRestartRequired` previously resolved to
`ActionNone` — the page told the user to restart and gave them nothing to
press. `updatepresent` renders it as a `destructive-action` button labelled
"Restart now", and `UpdateShell.StartRestart` calls `ublue.Restart`.

That restart is the run's only privileged surface of its own: the `restart`
subcommand on `chairlift-ublue-helper` running `systemctl reboot`, with a
fixed argv that takes no delay and no target. Scheduled restarts
(finupdate's "Restart Tonight", bluefinctl's reboot-on-logout) would each
need their own action rather than a parameter here, precisely because a time
argument crossing the boundary is another value the caller would control.
Everything else the run does goes through the providers' existing routes —
in particular the operating-system source stages through
`internal/bootc` (or `internal/sysupdate` on a native A/B host) and its
`/usr/libexec/…-stage` polkit action. There is deliberately no `bootc
upgrade` route on the ublue helper: adding one would break both the
staging-ownership rule and the system-integration package's fixed-path
contract.

The restart prompt's trigger deserves its own note: the OS source stages an
image rather than applying it, and the stage script is idempotent — it exits
0 without staging when the system is already current. So a successful OS
source is not by itself evidence that anything changed. `PhaseRestartRequired`
is reached only when a source's `ApplyResult` genuinely reported
`RestartRequired` and nothing is still pending.

Automatic background updates are no longer part of this surface. They are a
preference about the future rather than an action taken now, so they live in
their own `automatic_updates_group` on the same page
(`internal/views/automatic_updates.go`), gating only that one switch.

### Action journal and desktop notifications

`internal/journal` is a port of finupdate's `action_journal.rs`: one JSON
line per privileged action, appended when `$CHAIRLIFT_ACTION_JOURNAL` is set,
a no-op otherwise. A dry-run invocation is recorded with
`Suppressed: SuppressedDryRun` and the argv that would have run, which is
what lets a test assert intent ("clicking Switch would have run
`bootc switch ghcr.io/…/dakota:testing`") without granting privilege; see
`internal/ublue`'s `TestRunHelperJournalsEveryInvocation`.

ChairLift escalates through three choke points, and the record is written at
each of them rather than at the call sites that reach them:

| choke point | covers | polkit actions |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/helperexec.Run` | both fixed-path helper binaries, via `internal/ublue.runHelper` and `internal/updex.runHelper` | 9 `…ublue.*` + 3 `…updex.*` |
| `internal/stageexec.Stage` | both stage scripts, via `internal/bootc.StageUpdate` and `internal/sysupdate.StageUpdate` | `…bootc.stage`, `…sysupdate.stage` |
| `views.UserHome.runMaintenanceAction` | config-declared maintenance scripts run `sudo` | none; falls back to `org.freedesktop.policykit.exec` |

The staging and maintenance rows were added late: `helperexec` was for a long
time the only package honoring the contract, so the OS update — the least
undoable thing ChairLift does — left no audit entry, and an empty region of a
journal could mean either "staging never ran" or "staging ran and was not
recorded". `internal/installcheck`'s journal-contract gate now classifies
every `os/exec` call site under `internal/` as privileged or unprivileged and
requires each privileged one to record both suppression states, so a fourth
executor cannot reopen the hole silently.

`internal/notify` sends exactly one desktop `GNotification`: the unified
update run's completion (`notify.UpdateAllComplete`, sent from
`views.UpdateShell.notifyUpdateComplete`), through `views.ToastAdder.NotifyBackground` (implemented by
`internal/window.Window`, the one place holding a `*gtk.Application` handle).
It is the only ChairLift action long enough that a user plausibly stepped
away before it finished; every other toggle completes in view and already has
a toast, so a second notification there would be noise the simple-interface
constraint rules out.

### Enhanced Troubleshooting

`internal/troubleshoot` is ChairLift's port of Bluefin's `ujust probe`
recipe (`projectbluefin/dakota`, `files/just-overrides/default.just`): tap
`ublue-os/tap`, install `linux-mcp-server`, wire its `linux-tools` extension
into Goose, launch a session. The formula depends on `block-goose-cli`, so
one install brings the agent too; the `goose-linux` cask from the same tap
provides the desktop app, which is what ChairLift launches rather than
guessing at a terminal emulator.

The load-bearing detail is state detection. `goose-mcp-setup` prints a
snippet and exits 0 when `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` already exists, so a
user who has run `goose configure` gets a successful setup that wired up
nothing. `Detect` therefore reads the file for the `linux-tools` extension,
and `Setup` returns the state it actually left rather than the one it aimed
for — `TroubleshootSetupSubtitle` has a case for exactly that outcome.

`ParseConfig` decodes the file as YAML rather than scanning lines: a
`linux-tools` key anywhere is not the same fact as an enabled `linux-tools`
extension under `extensions:` carrying a type and a command, and only the
second one means the feature can actually run. The decode is read-only —
ChairLift still neither owns nor rewrites that file — and a malformed or
extension-less config yields `Wired` false. The provider is read and
displayed, never written — the default the setup script installs is
`gemini-cli`, which sends system details to Google, and the row says so.

Nothing crosses a privilege boundary: every piece is a user-scope Homebrew
install and linux-mcp-server's access is read-only.

### Staged-update changelog

`internal/sbom` answers "what actually changes if I take this update?" from
the images themselves rather than a hand-written changelog. The package is
split the usual way: `Parse`, `Diff`, and `CompareVersions` are pure and
fixture-tested, `RegistryClient.Fetch` does the registry round-trip, and
`Compare` takes the fetch as a `FetchFunc` seam so the gated tests never
reach the network.

Two registry behaviors shape the implementation, both verified against
ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable on 2026-08-17. First, GHCR returns 404 from
the OCI referrers API for these images; the SBOM is discoverable only through
the specification's fallback tag, the manifest digest rewritten as
`sha256-<hex>`, which returns an index carrying the artifact types. A client
that only calls the referrers API finds nothing on the registry that
publishes Bluefin. Second, the referrer advertised as
`application/vnd.spdx+json` is Syft JSON — a top-level `artifacts` array,
4,562 entries — so `Parse` accepts both shapes and treats "recognized
neither" as an error.

Version ordering follows rpm, including the tilde rule that makes `1.0~rc1`
precede `1.0`. Where the order genuinely cannot be established — two commit
hashes, or versions in unrelated formats — the pair lands in
`Result.Changed` rather than being guessed into `Upgraded`, because
presenting an unknown direction as an upgrade is how a rollback comes to look
like an update.

The UI is a drill-down inside the staged-update expander, not a page: the
diff only means anything relative to a specific staged update, and a page
would have to invent an answer for a system with nothing staged. The fetch is
never automatic.

### Local AI (the Agents page)

Local AI is its own destination, `agents_page`, built by
`internal/views/agents_page.go`. It was a group on the Features page, where it
sat between developer mode and gaming mode and read as one more system
preference; what it turns on is a service a person then points other
applications at, so it is a page with one group (`agents_group`) rather than
a switch among unrelated ones.

`internal/aistack` is ChairLift's answer to bluefinctl's `stacks/` directory.
bluefinctl ships twelve quadlet definitions under `nvidia/` and `amd/` and
makes the user choose one; ChairLift ships one runtime whose image is chosen
by the hardware. RamaLama publishes a per-accelerator image
(`quay.io/ramalama/{cuda,rocm,intel-gpu,ramalama}`), so `Select(gpu.Set)` is
the entire selection logic and every host — including Intel and GPU-less
ones, which bluefinctl's catalog cannot serve at all — gets a working answer.
Each of those four references is pinned to a multi-arch index digest rather
than `:latest`, so a re-pushed tag cannot silently replace the image and the
pin still resolves on CI's arm64 matrix leg.

The package splits the same way the rest of the codebase does: `Select` and
`RenderUnit` are pure and table-tested across all four hardware cases plus
the hybrid laptop, while the filesystem and `systemctl --user` calls sit
behind the `unitDir`/`runSystemctl` seams. Nothing is privileged — the
quadlet goes in the user's own `~/.config/containers/systemd` — so there is
no helper subcommand and no PolicyKit action, the same shape as gaming mode.
`IsEnabled` reads the unit file's presence rather than the service's runtime
state, because the first start pulls several gigabytes and a status-derived
switch would flicker for the whole pull.
Disabling stops `chairlift-ai.service` before removing the unit. A failed stop
is accepted only when a follow-up `systemctl --user is-active` reports the
service is no longer active or is not loaded; if the service remains active or
cannot be verified, the unit stays on disk and the UI surfaces the stop error.

### Powerwash and Factory Reset

`internal/powerwash` is Powerwash's pure sequencer, in the same shape as the
other pure runners: `Runner.Run` executes the two steps (removing every
user-scope Flatpak, removing every Distrobox container) through function
seams, and `Summarize` aggregates the outcome. A step whose tool is not
installed is `OutcomeSkipped`, not a failure — there is nothing for it to
remove. Both steps are unprivileged; `internal/flatpak.RemoveAllUser` and the
new `internal/distrobox` package (a minimal wrapper existing only to detect
Distrobox and remove every container) are the real implementations.

Factory Reset is `bootc install reset --experimental --apply`, dispatched
through a new `factory-reset` action on the existing `chairlift-ublue-helper`
— it takes no argument, since a factory reset has exactly one target, the
image already booted.

Both are gated by `maintenance_page`'s `reset_group`, which ships
`enabled: false` in `config.yml` (the same default as
`maintenance_cleanup_group`), and both require an `AdwAlertDialog`
confirmation with a destructive-styled response before anything runs — the
HIG's rule that destructive dialogs are reserved for genuinely non-undoable
actions. The confirmation text lives in `pageview.PowerwashConfirmation` and
`pageview.FactoryResetConfirmation`, table-tested to assert the Factory Reset
body names `--experimental` explicitly: `bootc`'s own reset path is not
stabilized upstream, and hiding that behind friendlier wording would be
exactly the kind of detail a confirmation dialog exists to surface.

### Automatic background updates

`internal/autoupdate` classifies the state of `uupd.timer`, the unit
Universal Blue images ship for unattended updates. It is read-only; the
privileged writes are `auto-updates-enable` / `auto-updates-disable` on
`chairlift-ublue-helper`.

The package exists because ChairLift presents this as **one switch** where
bluefinctl presents a strategy enum, a schedule picker, per-layer switches,
and a focus mode. Collapsing several systemd states into a binary control is
only safe if the mapping is explicit, which is what `Classify` is:

- `is-enabled` returning `""` or `not-found` — the unit is not installed, so
  `StateUnavailable`, and the switch is not shown at all.
- `masked` or `masked-runtime` — `StateOff`, whatever `is-active` says. A
  masked timer cannot run. This is also how bluefinctl's "manual" strategy
  and its "focus mode" are both represented on disk, and neither is
  distinguishable to a user who only wants to know whether the machine
  updates itself.
- `enabled`/`enabled-runtime` with an active timer — `StateOn`.
- `enabled` with an inactive or failed timer — `StateOff`. An enabled but dead
  timer updates nothing, and calling it on is a claim the user disproves only
  by never receiving an update.
- anything else (`disabled`, `static`, `indirect`) — `StateOff`.

Turning the switch on unmasks before enabling, because "off" has those two
on-disk representations and a machine ever set to manual would otherwise
refuse to turn back on. Turning it off masks rather than merely disabling, so
a `systemctl preset` run during a package upgrade cannot quietly re-enable
what the user turned off. The unit name is fixed in the helper: a
caller-supplied unit would let an authenticated user enable or mask anything
on the machine.

### The release-channel table

`internal/imageinfo` owns the mapping from a running image and tag to the tag
its stable or testing counterpart is published under. The mapping is keyed on
the **registry path**, not on the tag alone, because the same tag word means
different things across images. Verified against GHCR by manifest request,
most recently on 2026-09-21:

| Image | Stable streams | Testing streams |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin` | `latest`, `stable`, `stable-daily`, `gts`, `lts`, `lts-hwe` | `lts-testing`, `lts-hwe-testing` |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts` | `lts`, `stable` | `testing` |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota` | `latest`, `stable` | `testing` |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota-gaming` | `stable` | `testing` |

Three consequences follow, all of which a tag-only mapping gets wrong:

- `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:testing` does not exist. A Bluefin Stable host on
  `latest`, `stable`, `stable-daily`, or `gts` has **no testing counterpart**,
  and the Testing Channel switch is correctly rendered insensitive there. Only
  the `lts` and `lts-hwe` streams on that image are switchable. The `beta`
  stream is gone entirely: it answered 200 on 2026-08-17 and 404 on
  2026-09-21.
- `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts:lts-testing` does not exist either; that
  image's testing stream is the bare `testing` tag.
- The gaming image is a separate registry path, not a tag or variant of
  `dakota`, and it publishes no `latest`. `dakota-gaming` and its NVIDIA
  variant `dakota-nvidia-gaming` ship `stable`, `testing`, and the `next`
  stream (whose `btw` tag is an alias for the same digest). `next`/`btw` are
  deliberately unclassified: they are a third, more bleeding-edge stream, not
  a stable or testing counterpart of anything.

bluefinctl's `bctl toggle-testing` uses a tag-only map that targets both of
those nonexistent references. ChairLift does not reproduce it.

**Which tag the machine is actually on.** Resolving a channel needs the
running tag, and `/usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json`'s `image-tag` is not a
reliable answer on every image. Dakota promotes a stream by retagging an
existing digest rather than rebuilding, so every Dakota image — base, NVIDIA,
and gaming — bakes `image-tag: latest` whatever stream it ships on;
`projectbluefin/dakota` records this in `elements/bluefin/common.bst`, where
it patches fastfetch for the same reason. On a gaming host the baked value is
not merely imprecise, it names a tag that image does not publish at all.
`imageinfo.Detect` therefore also reads the boot-time marker
`/run/ublue-os/booted-image`, written by `ublue-booted-image.service`, and
`Info.EffectiveTag` prefers it. The marker is honoured only when it names the
image the descriptor names, so a stale marker from a previous deployment
cannot move a host onto another image's streams, and a digest-pinned marker
yields no tag at all — a pinned host is on no stream and is offered no switch.
A host without the marker keeps using the baked tag. Both the GUI and the
privileged helper obtain `Info` from `Detect`, so they always agree on the
running stream.

An image outside the table resolves to no channel and no switch, rather than
to a guessed tag suffix. Other images — TunaOS, a downstream rebuild, a
private registry — are added by shipping a `channels.yml`, not by editing Go:

| Path | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/chairlift/channels.yml` | administrator |
| `/usr/share/chairlift/channels.yml` | image maintainer |

Those two paths, in that order, are the only ones consulted. Unlike
`internal/config`'s search order they deliberately exclude the working
directory: the privileged helper resolves its `bootc switch` target through
this same table, so a user-writable table would let a local user redirect an
authenticated system switch. The GUI calls `imageinfo.LoadSystemTable()` at
startup so it can fail closed when a table-dependent control cannot resolve a
target. After validating argv, the helper loads that same table only for
`channel-switch` and `driver-switch`; a malformed override rejects those two
image-targeting operations but leaves the unrelated fixed privileged commands
available. A file that fails validation is rejected whole — a half-applied
mapping is exactly the situation that produces a wrong switch target — and the
file must contain exactly one YAML document, so content after a `---` boundary
is rejected rather than silently ignored: the helper must never resolve a
mapping the GUI did not read. The file configures release channels under
`images:` and graphics-driver variants under `drivers:`. Driver entries map a
base image registry path to supported driver flavours (`standard` required,
`nvidia`, `nvidia-open`) and their published streams.
`channels.example.yml` documents both formats and is installed to
`/usr/share/doc/chairlift/`; no live table is ever packaged.

Separately, `polkitd` reads application policies from the fixed directory
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions` — not `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, not any
`$PREFIX`-derived path — so the Makefile's `install`/`uninstall` targets
require `PREFIX=/usr` (the default since issue #59) for a source install's
polkit assets to land somewhere polkit actually looks. These constraints are
system facts, not values ChairLift decides; the Makefile and
`internal/updex.HelperPath` exist to conform to them, matching the layout
`.goreleaser.yaml`'s nFPM packages already use.

**System-integration delivery:** GoReleaser publishes two mutually exclusive
package shapes. `projectbluefin-chairlift` is the existing self-contained package
with the GUI binary, both privileged helper binaries, desktop assets,
maintainer config, the channel-table example, and policies. The
`projectbluefin-chairlift-system-integration` package is the root-owned companion
for a user-scoped GUI delivery such as the Homebrew cask: its build filter
contains only `chairlift-updex-helper` and `chairlift-ublue-helper`, and its
contents contain these installed paths: `/usr/bin/chairlift-updex-helper`,
`/usr/bin/chairlift-ublue-helper`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.bootc.policy`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.sysupdate.policy`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.updex.policy`,
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/io.projectbluefin.chairlift.ublue.policy`,
`/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml`, and
`/usr/share/doc/chairlift/channels.example.yml`. The packages declare conflicts
because they intentionally own the same privileged files.

The integration package does **not** ship `bootc-update-stage` or
`snosi-sysupdate-stage`. Those operations are distro policy, so an image that
enables `bootc_updates_group` must provide a trusted implementation at the
existing fixed `/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` path, and native A/B images
ship `/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` (plus the `/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab`
marker) themselves. Keeping the paths fixed preserves the PolicyKit executable
boundary; making either a user-writable config value would allow the GUI
configuration to redirect a root execution. The page already gates each group
on its script-availability check (`bootc.StageScriptAvailable`,
`sysupdate.StageScriptAvailable`), so an absent distro helper hides the
operation.

### Maintenance page structure and action execution

The Maintenance page holds three things, ordered by how often a person needs
them and inversely by what they cost.

First, one routine cleanup action. `maintenance_freespace_group` is a single
"Free up space" button that composes the typed cleanup runner already used by
the update run's post-update maintenance step (`internal/updateproviders.Cleanup`, whose
`CleanupGroup` constant *is* `maintenance_freespace_group`). One key gates
both surfaces deliberately: a user who turned cleanup off has turned cleanup
off, and two keys would let one surface clean while the other claimed the
feature was disabled. It replaces a row of per-package-manager buttons, which
asked the user to know which package manager owned their wasted disk space.

`internal/views/cleanupview` owns the decidable half: the row and group text,
the per-step `Label`, and `Summarize`, which turns the run's `StepResult`
slice into one sentence that never claims more than happened — an absent
provider was skipped, a dismissed authentication cleaned nothing, and a
reclaimed-bytes figure is shown only when both free-space readings succeeded
and the difference exceeds `MinReportableBytes` (1 MB), because free space
moves on a live system for reasons that have nothing to do with the action.

Second, whatever maintenance the administrator configured
(`maintenance_cleanup_group`), labelled as theirs and never folded into the
button above, because ChairLift knows only a title and a command.

Third, Recovery (`reset_group`) — Powerwash and Factory Reset. The group is
titled "Recovery" rather than anything resembling cleanup, precisely so a
person looking for disk space does not press it. Its opt-in default and
mandatory confirmations are unchanged; see "Powerwash and Factory Reset".

Configurable maintenance scripts (from `config.yml` `actions` entries) are executed via `runMaintenanceAction()` in `internal/views/maintenance_page.go`. The pattern:

1. `decision := actionmsg.MaintenanceScript(dryrun.Enabled(), title)` is computed once, before the goroutine, from the single process-wide dry-run flag (see "Dry-run mode" above)
2. Button is disabled and label set to "Running..."
3. A goroutine checks `decision.Execute`: when true it spawns the script via `exec.CommandContext` (5-minute timeout), using `pkexec` wrapper if `sudo: true`, exactly as before; when false (dry-run) it constructs no `exec.Cmd` at all and just logs `[DRY-RUN] Would execute: ...`
4. On completion, the main thread re-enables the button and shows `decision.Toast` (dry-run) or a success/error toast for the real run

### Keyboard shortcuts

`internal/navigation` is the single puregotk-free authority for sidebar page
order, titles, icons, advertised shortcuts, registered accelerators, and the
complete page-selection transition. Its item metadata also maps every page to
the groups that actually build content. `navigation.VisibleItems` filters that
inventory using `Config.IsGroupEnabled`, always retains Help, and assigns
compacted Alt+number keys. `internal/window` uses the result for its sidebar,
stack, actions, initial selection, and shortcuts dialog. After construction,
`internal/app` registers `navigation.Bindings(window.NavigationItems())`, so
the registered and advertised keys use the exact same visible inventory.

The accelerators are:

- `Ctrl+Q` → quit
- `Ctrl+?` → show shortcuts dialog
- `Alt+1` through `Alt+N` → navigate to the first through Nth visible page in
  canonical order, with omitted pages leaving no gaps
- `F1` → navigate to Help (the same `win.navigate-help` action as Help's
  current compacted Alt+number binding)

Mouse row activation and keyboard navigation actions both call
`Window.navigateToPage`. That method calls `navigation.Resolve` against the
visible inventory, rejects an omitted or unconstructed page, then applies all
four successful outcomes: select the compacted sidebar row, set the stack's
visible child, update the content-page title, and set
`NavigationSplitView.show-content` true so a collapsed layout reveals the
destination. `internal/navigation` tests every functional page with all of its
groups disabled, each builder-backed group individually enabled, the Help-only
fallback, compacted indices/accelerators, unavailable and unknown rejection,
the complete advertised-to-registered shortcut inventory, the F1 Help
binding, and static app/window wiring. No `_test.go` is added to the
puregotk-importing `internal/window` or `internal/app` packages.

Note: `GtkShortcutsWindow` is not available in puregotk, so a custom `adw.Window` with `adw.PreferencesGroup` rows is used for the shortcuts dialog.

### URL opening

Help page links are opened via `xdg-open` using `exec.Command`. The process is started asynchronously and its exit is waited on in a goroutine to avoid zombie processes.

## Configuration

Decision records: [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-two-tier-config-with-fail-closed-semantics.md)
(config search order and fail-closed semantics),
[ADR-0004](../adr/0004-configuration-error-diagnostic-vocabulary.md)
(the `CONFIGURATION ERROR` diagnostic vocabulary), and
[ADR-0005](../adr/0005-config-schema-reflected-from-canonical-struct.md)
(the reflected schema and overlay semantics).

### Config file search order

1. `/etc/chairlift/config.yml` — system-wide (highest priority)
2. `/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml` — package-maintainer defaults installed
   by both source `make install` and nFPM packages
3. `config.dev.yml` — source-checkout fallback, beside the executable when
   present, otherwise relative to the current working directory
4. `config.yml` — legacy development fallback, beside the executable when
   present, otherwise relative to the current working directory

Only a missing candidate advances the search. The first existing candidate is
authoritative; a read, parse, type, or schema error disables every feature
group and produces both a high-signal log entry and a persistent toast. If no
file is found, all features default to enabled except
`maintenance_cleanup_group` and `reset_group`, which default to disabled. See
[CONFIG.md](../../CONFIG.md) for the full reference.

Both packaging paths own only the `/usr/share` candidate and may replace it on
upgrade. Neither writes `/etc/chairlift/config.yml`; that higher-precedence
path remains administrator-owned, so local policy is never overwritten by a
ChairLift install or package update.
The repository root's `config.dev.yml` shadows `config.yml` only in development
fallback loading; packages still install `config.yml` as the trusted
`/usr/share/chairlift/config.yml` maintainer default.

## Build and Release

- **Build**: `make build` builds three binaries: `build/chairlift` (main app), `build/chairlift-updex-helper` (privileged updex helper), and `build/chairlift-ublue-helper` (privileged Bluefin-family helper), all with `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- **CI mirror**: `make ci` runs every host-independent gate from `.github/workflows/test.yml` in fail-fast order — go.mod tidy check, `go vet`, gofmt check, `golangci-lint`, unit tests (`./internal/...` under `-run "^Test[^I]" -skip "Integration"`), the race detector, and the build. Its build step reproduces CI's `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` matrix into `build/ci-linux-<arch>/` before rebuilding natively, so a compile failure on the non-host architecture cannot pass locally. The mill's deep gate (`.mill.toml`) calls this target. Codecov's remote project status additionally rejects coverage regressions greater than one percentage point, with no fixed project or patch target; it cannot be mirrored locally. The runtime-dependent E2E job is deliberately separate: `make e2e` builds all three binaries, executes the application's `--help` path, boots the dry-run GTK window under a private D-Bus/Xvfb session, polls all three readiness markers for at most 30 seconds, requires one second of post-readiness stability, then terminates its private process group and waits for every surviving member of it to exit before Go removes the temporary `HOME` those workers write into, stages the real `make install` layout under a temporary `DESTDIR`, and executes the staged helper binaries' rejection paths. Its Go test package lives at `test/e2e`, imports no puregotk package, and is enforced by that explicit target rather than the `./internal/...` unit-test filter. The readiness markers are a log-line contract — decision record [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-e2e-readiness-is-a-log-marker-contract.md).
- **Dev build**: `make dev` builds with `CGO_ENABLED=1` and `-race` flag for race detection
- **Version**: Set via ldflags by goreleaser (`buildVersion`)
- **Semantic versioning**: Uses [svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) via `make bump`
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflows for test and release (`.github/workflows/`);
  the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, job `goreleaser`) runs
  GoReleaser OSS with `GITHUB_TOKEN` to publish the tagged commit's artifacts
  straight to GitHub Releases. There is no separate snapshot workflow; the
  `snapshot:` block in `.goreleaser.yaml` only sets the version template for
  local `goreleaser release --snapshot` builds and is not used by any workflow. Every external
  `uses:` reference in every workflow is pinned to a full 40-character commit
  SHA (with its version or source ref retained as a comment);
  `internal/installcheck.TestWorkflowActionsUseImmutableCommitSHAs` inventories
  both `.yml` and `.yaml` workflow files and rejects mutable tags, branches,
  short SHAs, and expressions while allowing repository-local `./` actions.
- **Release**: GoReleaser config at `.goreleaser.yaml` (GoReleaser OSS, run in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`). The repository URL is a
  literal in `release.footer`'s "Full Changelog" line — there is no
  `metadata.homepage` to template from, since OSS has no `metadata:` block —
  and that literal is the single source of truth for it; a static test guards
  it — see the "Install-path consistency (`internal/installcheck`)" section of
  [package-managers.md](./package-managers.md#install-path-consistency-internalinstallcheck).
  The `snapshot:` block in `.goreleaser.yaml` configures local
  `goreleaser release --snapshot` builds and needs no workflow.
- **Other targets**: `make fmt` (gofmt), `make lint` (golangci-lint), `make install`/`make uninstall` (system install including polkit policies, icons, and wrapper script; default `PREFIX=/usr`, the only prefix that matches where polkit reads policy files and the fixed pkexec exec-path annotations for both helper binaries — see "Privileged operations" above), `make build-linux-amd64`/`make build-linux-arm64` (cross-compilation)

### Runtime dependencies

- GTK 4 and libadwaita 1 (shared libraries loaded at runtime by puregotk)
- Homebrew (optional)
- Flatpak (optional)
- `bootc` + `/usr/libexec/bootc-update-stage` (both optional; UI gated on `bootc.IsBootcBootedCached()`, i.e. `bootc status` reporting a non-null `booted` deployment — not on any sentinel file)
- `/usr/lib/snosi/native-ab` marker + `/usr/libexec/snosi-sysupdate-stage` (both optional, shipped by native A/B OS images; UI gated on `sysupdate.IsNativeABCached()` and `sysupdate.StageScriptAvailable()`)
- Updex features configured on the system (optional; read via Go library, writes via `chairlift-updex-helper`)
- `/usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json` (optional; present on Bluefin, Bluefin LTS, and Dakota). Its absence is the normal case on Snow Linux and hides the three Bluefin-family groups entirely
- `bootc` (optional; used by `chairlift-ublue-helper` for the release-channel switch)
- `usermod`/`gpasswd` (optional; used by `chairlift-ublue-helper` for developer mode)
- Flatpak with a Flathub remote (optional; gaming mode installs its components user-scoped)

There is no separate Go client library dependency for bootc: status/stage types (`Status`, `Deployment`, `ProgressEvent`, etc.) are defined locally in `internal/bootc`, parsed directly from `bootc status --format json` and the stage script's line output.
